## An Established Plan of Study
All students are required to complete a Plan of Study, outlining their anticipated coursework and clinical experiences for each term. This plan helps ensure timely progress toward graduation and is often used to verify eligibility for financial aid, course prerequisites, and internship placement.

Students should complete their Plan of Study in consultation with their academic advisor during their first semester. The plan is flexible and can be updated as needed to reflect changes in goals, course availability, or field placements.

Students should also download and maintain the [Degree Worksheet](https://github.com/rlfarmer27/MAEDSHandbook/raw/main/docs/resources/chron_degreeworksheet.docx) throughout the program. It serves as a personal record of progress and a helpful tool during advising sessions.

The following section provides a detailed course sequence in chronological order. Students are expected to download and complete the degree worksheet. This will support advising and help you stay organized as you progress through the program.

The MA/EdS Program requires 61 semester hours divided across the two degrees.
