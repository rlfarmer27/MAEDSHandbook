Through integrated coursework, closely supervised fieldwork, and a strong emphasis on applied research, the program develops professionals who are equipped to serve diverse children, families, and schools. 1.1 Mission and Values The mission of the MA/EdS Program in School Psychology is to prepare graduates who are ready to provide evidence-based, culturally responsive services to children, families, and schools. Grounded in the scientist-practitioner model, the program emphasizes critical thinking, professional ethics, and collaborative problem-solving. We are committed to: - Equitable service delivery across diverse settings - Developing professional skills through real-world experience - Supporting the well-being and learning of all children - Upholding the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct - Preparing students for long-term success in practice or doctoral-level study 1.2 Degrees Awarded Students who complete the program earn the following degrees: - Master of Arts (MA) in Psychology - Education Specialist (EdS) in School Psychology These degrees are awarded concurrently, and both are required for program completion and credentialing. 1.3 Relationship with the Doctoral Program Students in the MA/EdS program take many of their courses alongside students in the School Psychology doctoral program. This shared coursework fosters collaboration, shared learning, and familiarity with advanced topics in the field. Furthermore, the majority of applied skills for doctoral-level school psychologists are the same as those required of MA/EdS-level practitioners, especially in areas such as assessment, consultation, and intervention. MA/EdS students are also welcome to participate in faculty research labs, attend research group meetings, and pursue additional research experience beyond program requirements. These opportunities are especially encouraged for students considering future doctoral study. Students interested in continuing into the doctoral program may apply directly from the MA/EdS program. While acceptance is not automatic, many MA/EdS students have successfully transitioned into the doctoral program. Requirements for the doctoral degree are maintained in a separate handbook, and prospective applicants are encouraged to speak with the program director for guidance on planning and application. 1.4 Duration and Structure The program is designed as a three-year, full-time sequence: - Years 1–2: Campus-based coursework, practicum experiences, and research activities - Year 3: Full-time internship in an approved school or community-based setting Students begin field experiences during their first semester and build toward increasingly independent practice under supervision. A minimum of 60 semester credit hours is required for graduation. 1.5 NASP Approval The MA/EdS Program in School Psychology has been approved by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) since 1998. The program most recently hosted a site visit as part of its regular review cycle and is currently awaiting updated approval results. Graduates of NASP-approved programs are eligible to apply for the Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP) credential. 1.6 Accreditation and State Approval The University of Memphis is fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC). The School Psychology Program is also consistent with guidelines from the Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE), and graduates meet the educational requirements for licensure as a school psychologist in Tennessee and many other states. If you are planning to practice in a state other than Tennessee, please consult with the program director and review that state’s licensure guidelines. 1.7 Admission Requirements The criteria for admission to the MA/EdS and the PhD programs appear in the UM Graduate Bulletin and include quantitative and qualitative measures. No single measure is used in making a decision. Rather, the entire application file is reviewed to make a judgment of a student’s probable success in training to become a school psychologist. See also the Policy for Admission to the MA/EdS Program in this handbook, in Section III. Some students apply to the program as non-degree students seeking only admission to complete the work necessary for an endorsement for state department of education credentialing. These applications are reviewed against the usual admission requirements and ensure that appropriate degrees and work have already been satisfactorily completed, The Policy for Endorsement of Non-Degree School Psychology Licensure Students is also available in Section III. For the time being, the program is not reviewing requests for non-degree school psychology licensure. 1.8 Advising Student progress is reviewed during regular advising each semester. This applies to degree and endorsement only students. The policies regarding Responsibility for Student Advising and for Periodic Evaluation of Students are both present in Section III. Policies for the advising of doctoral students are covered in the doctoral handbook. Dr. Farmer serves as the primary advisor for MA/EdS students and Dr. Meisinger for the PhD students.

While school-clinical psychology offerings and an MA degree program were available during the period 1960-1975, a jointly sponsored MA/EdS program (Department of Psychology and COE) was formally initiated in 1976. It was an outgrowth of changes in the requirements for Tennessee State Department of Education certification (now licensure) of school psychologists in Tennessee (circa 1975) and the need for a revised school psychology program at what was then called Memphis State University. The revised program, a 45 semester hour MA degree, was developed by a School Psychology Coordinating Committee (SPCC), established at the request of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. The SPCC functioned as the policy-making body for the jointly sponsored MA/EdS program until August 2015. The new MA program was the first instance of a school psychology specific degree and the hiring of faculty in the area of school psychology. Dr. Thomas Fagan, the first bona fide school psychologist faculty member, was hired for the 1976-1977 school year. Dr. Bruce Bracken joined the faculty in 1986 and left in 1999. Dr. Wendy Naumann served from 1998-2001. Dr. Randy Floyd joined the program in fall 2001, Dr. Robin Phaneuf served from 2002-2006 and Dr. Laura Casey served in her position on an interim basis in 2006-2007 as a visiting assistant professor. Dr. Elizabeth Meisinger joined the faculty in fall 2007 and Dr. Xu (Lilya) Jiang joined the faculty in fall 2015 and left in June 2020. Dr. Sarah Irby was hired as a clinical assistant professor in fall 2020 and in fall 2021 was appointed interim director of the MA/EdS program when Dr. Fagan retired as an emeritus professor in August 2021. Drs. Emily Srisarajivakul and Ryan Farmer joined the faculty in fall 2022. Dr. Ryan Farmer assumed the role of director of the MA/EdS program in fall 2023. Dr. Sarah Irby left the faculty in spring 2024. Dr. Michelle Washington joined the faculty in Fall 2024. Drs. Meisinger, Srisarajivakul, Washington, Farmer, and Floyd currently constitute the core program faculty and are supported by faculty in other areas of the Psychology Department, the COE, and local practitioners who assist with instruction and field supervision. Faculty appointment history is displayed in figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Timeline of MA/EdS Program Faculty. Administered from the Psychology Department, the jointly sponsored MA/EdS program was indirectly overseen by the Dean of the COE and the Chair of the Psychology Department. The MA/EdS program was governed by a 10-member School Psychology Coordinating Committee (SPCC; 4 members chosen from Psychology, 4 chosen from the COE, and 2 students). All policies and curricula related to this program were the responsibility of the committee and were implemented by the MA/EdS program Director. The Associate Dean for Graduate Studies served as the program’s primary contact in the COE. The SPCC developed a set of policy statements for the program as well as the original 45 semester hour Master’s degree in 1975-1976 and the revised versions of those policies appear in this Handbook. The current 60-66 semester hour combined MA/EdS degree curriculum was initiated in 1982; the one-school year internship requirement was part of the EdS having previously been one semester. The PhD program was initiated in 1991 but governed by the policies of the Psychology Department’s PhD major. Program curricula and requirements for the different programs (MA/EdS and PhD) were determined entirely by the SPCC and by the Psychology Department, respectively. Starting in the fall of 2014, the directorship of the two programs was split with Dr. Fagan continuing as the director of the MA/EdS program and Dr. Floyd assuming the directorship of the PhD program. The programs continued to overlap in several areas of the curriculum and other areas (e.g., School Psychology Association, SPCC representation, field placements). In the summer of 2015 at a meeting of the core faculty with the UM Provost, the Interim Dean of the College of Education, and the chair of the Department of Psychology, it was agreed to restructure the governance of the MA/EdS program by drawing it into the governance of the Psychology Department. A revised School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC) was created to oversee the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD programs. The 2015 restructured governance arrangement retains the separate directorships, and the chair of the SPPC rotates among the two directors. The revised structure appears in this Handbook in Section III: Program Policies, Chapter 15 for more details. With the change in governance, some changes were also made to the curriculum. For several years the program struggled to have certain courses in the COE offered on a regular basis and/or to focus the content more toward the needs of the school psychology students. This was especially true of courses in counseling theory and academic interventions. With the addition of a fourth school psychology faculty member, it was feasible to shift the content of those intervention courses into the core sequence of school psychology (7/8800 courses). Additional optional courses were also recommended in some areas (e.g., research design) and two intervention electives from counseling, special education, and educational psychology were added. The revised curriculum was in effect for students entering in fall, 2016 through spring 2025. In fall, 2025, minor adjustments to the curriculum were made to account for changes within the College of Education that impact course availability. Those changes are reflection in Section II: Program Description, Chapter 11 for more details. The MA/EdS program has been accredited by NASP/NCATE (now CAEP) since the 1970s and first received NCATE/NASP approval in 1988. This approval has been uninterrupted and is active through December 2024. In 2024, the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) was recognized by the Council for Higher Education as an accrediting organization in 2023. The program’s first self study and site visit for accreditation with NASP was completed during the 2024-2025 academic year; results are anticipated in fall 2025. Accreditation of the PhD program from the American Psychological Association was awarded in fall, 2014 and is active until 2021 (extended due to COVID-19 pandemic); the program’s accreditation was renewed in spring, 2024 and is active until 2034.

The primary mission of the Department of Psychology is to advance the science and profession of psychology through the production and dissemination of knowledge related to the discipline, and the preparation of academic and professional psychologists. Consistent with the mission of the Center for Applied Psychological Research (CAPR), departmental emphasis is placed upon scholarly activities which maintain and enhance the department’s national research reputation. The department strives to provide high quality liberal and general education for undergraduate students, a coherent, high-quality program for its majors and graduate students, service courses to students in other majors, and services to the general public. The breadth of the faculty’s commitment is reflected in graduate programs in both basic and applied science and in diverse research and scholarly pursuits. The department’s mission is consistent with the university’s mission to advance learning through excellence in teaching, research, and service. In 2020-2021 the department employed 22 full-time and 10 Non-Tenure-Track faculty (including adjuncts), and 24 full-time office staff including the Institute for Intelligent Systems (IIS) and the Psychological Services Center (PSC). History and Degrees: Psychology was established as an independent department in 1947. Authorization to award the master’s degree was granted in 1960 and the first such degree was granted in 1962. The Ph.D. program in psychology was begun in 1966. For fall semester 2021 there were 112 students enrolled: There were 40 doctoral students in clinical, 12 in experimental, and 15 in school psychology. There were 29 students enrolled in the Master of Science in General Psychology (MSGP) and 16 in the Master of Arts/Educational Specialist in School Psychology (MA/EdS) Program. Graduate students have a voice in policy and decision-making through elected representatives to the department, and students are full members of several committees in the department. The training program in clinical psychology has been continuously accredited by the American Psychological Association since 1972. The MA/EdS program in school psychology has been continuously NASP approved since 1988. The PhD school psychology program was accredited by the APA in fall, 2014. More detailed history about the program is available in Chapter 3. Facilities: The Department of Psychology occupies a building of 88,000 square feet on the main University campus. This four-story structure contains two complete floors of animal and human research laboratories allowing all types of psychological investigation, a clinic (Psychological Services Center), undergraduate laboratories, a data analysis center, classrooms, and offices for all Psychology Department faculty and full-time graduate students. Classrooms are modern and equipped with computer, projection equipment, and internet access. The department’s laboratories and clinic are outfitted completely with modern equipment sufficient for faculty or student research or training activities. Additional space exists in the nearby FedEx Institute of Technology Bldg. The University maintains a modern computer center with numerous networked connections in the Department of Psychology. Student access to this system is readily available. The department owns many network-connected computers. Wireless internet access is available to faculty and students in all campus instructional buildings. The department also houses two computer laboratories that are used for both research and teaching. Online and distance learning facilities have expanded to meet the needs of continued instruction and business operations during the pandemic. The Psychological Services Center (PSC). The PSC at the University of Memphis offers a wide range of services to the university and the public. The Center is the training and service delivery unit of the Psychology Department’s graduate programs in clinical and school psychology. Psychological and psychoeducational assessment, consultation, and intervention services are available by graduate students and advanced Ph.D. candidates who are directly supervised by clinical and school psychologists from the Memphis community and the University faculty.

Founded in 1984, the Center for Applied Psychological Research (CAPR) is one of the original Tennessee Centers of Excellence, now designated an Accomplished Center of Excellence. The CAPR faculty have attracted millions of dollars in extramural funding to the State of Tennessee, published hundreds of scholarly works, graduated hundreds of masters and doctoral students and many times that number of undergraduates, been elected or appointed to many national professional offices, and won numerous local and national honors and awards. The primary CAPR goals are (a) to achieve national prominence for its accomplishments, (b) to increase the number of trained psychologists able to conduct, disseminate, and apply such research, and (c) to secure extramural funding to facilitate research and training. In addition, as part of a Psychology Department in a major urban research university, CAPR supports the general teaching, research, and service missions of the department and university. Center funds are also used to sponsor major conferences that allow top psychologists from this country and throughout the world to visit our department. The primary mission of the Center for Applied Psychological Research (CAPR) at The University of Memphis is to support psychological research. As part of a major urban research university, a primary focus of this mission is the application of psychological knowledge to finding solutions to individual and social problems – local, regional, and national. Therefore, CAPR research focuses extensively on problems concerning health, mental health, education, schools, crime, the environment, and children and their families. In addition, to increasing our capacity for generating new approaches to applied problems, CAPR also supports basic scientific research in cognitive psychology, biopsychology, social psychology, developmental psychology, and research design and statistics. Collaboration: Faculty and graduate students conduct research and work on collaborative service projects in numerous community agencies, including the Desoto County Schools, Shelby County Schools, the municipal school districts of Arlington, Bartlett, Collierville, Germantown, Lakeland, and Millington, area charter schools and the Achievement School Districts including the ASPIRE Schools; Shelby County Head Start, the Boling Developmental Disabilities Center, the Veterans Administration Medical Center, the Departments of Psychiatry, Community Medicine, Pediatrics and Preventive Medicine at the University of Tennessee-Center for the Health Sciences-Memphis, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, the Memphis Mental Health Institute, agencies and departments of the City of Memphis, the University’s Center for Student Development and Disability Resources for Students, and several community agencies. Administrators of these agencies are receptive to making their facilities and subject populations available for diverse psychological research projects and clinical services. Several distinguished scholars in psychology and related areas visit the department each year to present colloquia and workshops to faculty and students. The speakers represent a variety of current subject matter areas within psychology and have contributed to the Department’s Diversity Series held across the academic year. Additionally, the local chapters of Sigma Xi and other campus and community groups often invite scholars in psychology and related disciplines to Memphis. Research Areas: The faculty, students, and programs are spread over 5 research areas: Behavioral Neuroscience; Child and Family Studies; Clinical Health Psychology; Cognitive Psychology; and Psychotherapy Research. All faculty and students in the school psychology programs are affiliated with the Child and Family Studies area. The Child, Adolescent, and Family Studies (CAFS) Research Area. CAFS includes faculty and students from several department programs including Child Clinical Psychology, Developmental Psychology, and School Psychology and represents all three of the department’s doctoral degree concentrations (Clinical, Experimental, and School). The common core of faculty research interests is a commitment to examining age-related cognitive, cultural, emotional, health, and social factors across infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Basic and applied research projects are conducted in a variety of settings, including community agencies, day care and preschool programs, homes, hospitals, and schools. From this diversity across faculty interests, graduate students can construct individualized programs of study and be involved with a wide variety of research topics and populations. CFS faculty have teaching assignments to courses related to the research area, and many provide supervised practicum experiences through the department’s Psychological Services Center. Colloquium meetings are scheduled as needed on Friday afternoons during which faculty, students, and community partners present research findings.

Back to top Last updated: August 13, 2025 "],["philosophy.html", "8 Program Philosophy", " 8 Program Philosophy A societal emphasis has been placed on schools to provide a better future for children through a life-long educative process. In their professional roles, school psychologists are sensitive to the needs of a culturally diverse community, value the importance of children to the future of society, and advocate on behalf of children. As an integral part of human services available to children, adolescents, adults, and families, school psychologists’ function across multiple settings with a focus on educational institutions. School psychologists address diverse referral issues with varied services such as psychoeducational assessment, consultation, counseling and other interventions, in-service education, administrative services, research and evaluation. The primary distinction that separates school psychology from other psychological specialties is the combining of education and psychology in the study and delivery of services to children, youth, families, and learners of all ages. The additional focus of education to this area of psychology stems from the assumption that schools play a primary nurturing and socializing role in the lives of all individuals. School psychologists focus on the natural ecologies of children, youth, families, learners, and persons involved in schooling, and the process of schooling in multiple settings. Because of their training in both education and psychology, school psychologists are in a unique position to coordinate educational, psychological, and behavioral health services to learners across the life span. The curriculum of our program is an integrated course of study in areas of education and psychology that contribute to the preparation of school psychologists, in addition to a core of school psychology courses. Figure 8.1: Conceptual model of program philosophy. The overall philosophy of the school psychology program at The University of Memphis is an ecological, empirically based model that focuses on the multiple systems in which children exist. This perspective recognizes the complex interaction of person variables within and across multiple systems. This philosophy also acknowledges that the way problems are defined influences the subsequent use of assessment and intervention strategies. Using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model (panel A) and Bandura’s notion of reciprocal determinism (panel B), this blend of problem definition and system analysis is driven by the following premises. The client is not only the center of the ecological model but is also an active participant who brings multiple dynamics to the model. The context in which the client resides includes multiple systems that have both direct and indirect influences. The microsystem includes immediate environments such as home, school, and community. Larger systems such as the cultural and political context of the community (e.g., exosystem and macrosystem) influence the client’s microsystem indirectly. The mesosytem includes interactions between the client and his/her microsystem and the larger systems. A reciprocal relationship exists between client and system. The client acts on his/her environment exerting control and influence over variables in the immediate and larger systems. Also, the multiple contexts in which the client resides influence the psycho-social development, adjustment and educational experiences and performance of the client. School psychologists intervene in the ecology in multiple ways. For existing concerns, problems are defined with information related to the client, the multiple contexts, and the interaction between the client and context. This information guides the practice of school psychology including prevention, assessment, and intervention services. Additionally, school psychologists provide services that assist in the creation of healthy individuals and systems. These services focus on wellness and maintenance of healthy environments and individuals. The overarching program model reflects the scientist-practitioner approach that balances knowledge, competencies, and skills in both research and practice. Students draw upon scientific literature to make decisions regarding practice with a focus on selecting and using empirically supported services while avoiding untested, ineffective, unnecessary, or harmful practices. Students are also instructed regarding basic program evaluation techniques and treatment monitoring and evaluation to determine the effectiveness of their assessment and interventions. In addition to these skill areas, doctoral students are trained in more advanced design and statistical techniques to become producers of scientific knowledge for the practice of school psychology. All students are taught to use a scientific, problem focused model to make clinical decisions by operationalizing problems, identifying appropriate data collection techniques, analyzing, and interpreting data collected, and utilized the findings to determine the target variables for intervention. The MA/EdS program focuses on practitioner training for the delivery of comprehensive school psychological services primarily in school settings. The training of practitioner skills follows a curricular sequence in assessment and intervention with a focus on linking problem-solving assessment and intervention to all roles of the school psychologist. In this manner the curriculum is constructed along the lines of NASP’s Model for Comprehensive and Integrated School Psychological Services, and its related standards for program approval. In addition to practitioner skills, MA/EdS students are trained in a “scientist as consumer” model which emphasizes the use of research findings and evidenced-based practices in clinical decision-making. Program Goals and Content Domains The overall goal of the MA/EdS program is that students will successfully complete the domain-related requirements of the program, obtain credentialing for school-based practice from the Tennessee Department of Education or comparable authority in other states, and seek National Certification in School Psychology (NCSP). The MA/EdS curriculum and student evaluations are organized to be consistent with the following NASP domains, See the domain-course crosswalk in Chapter 11. "],["domains.html", "9 2020 Domains of School Psychology Training &amp; Practice", " 9 2020 Domains of School Psychology Training &amp; Practice Domain 1: Data-Based Decision Making: School psychologists understand and utilize assessment methods for identifying strengths and needs; developing effective interventions, services, and programs; and measuring progress and outcomes within a multitiered system of support. School psychologists use a problem-solving framework as the basis for all professional activities. School psychologists systematically collect data from multiple sources as a foundation for decision-making at the individual, group, and systems levels, and they consider ecological factors (e.g., classroom, family, and community characteristics) as a context for assessment and intervention. Domain 2: Consultation and Collaboration: School psychologists understand varied models and strategies of consultation and collaboration applicable to individuals, families, groups, and systems, as well as methods to promote effective implementation of services. As part of a systematic and comprehensive process of effective decision making and problem solving that permeates all aspects of service delivery, school psychologists demonstrate skills to consult, collaborate, and communicate effectively with others. Domain 3: Academic Interventions and Instructional Supports: School psychologists understand the biological, cultural, and social influences on academic skills; human learning, cognitive, and developmental processes; and evidence-based curricula and instructional strategies. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, use assessment and data collection methods to implement and evaluate services that support academic skill development in children. Domain 4: Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions: School psychologists understand the biological, cultural, developmental, and social influences on mental and behavioral health, behavioral and emotional impacts on learning, and evidence-based strategies to promote social–emotional functioning. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, design, implement, and evaluate services that promote resilience and positive behavior, support socialization and adaptive skills, and enhance mental and behavioral health. Domain 5: School-Wide Practices to Promote Learning: School psychologists understand systems structures, organization, and theory; general and special education programming; implementation science; and evidence-based, school-wide practices that promote learning, positive behavior, and mental health. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, develop and implement practices and strategies to create and maintain safe, effective, and supportive learning environments for students and school staff. Domain 6: Services to Promote Safe and Supportive Schools: School psychologists understand principles and research related to social–emotional well-being, resilience and risk factors in learning, mental and behavioral health, services in schools and communities to support multitiered prevention and health promotion, and evidence-based strategies for creating safe and supportive schools. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, promote preventive and responsive services that enhance learning, mental and behavioral health, and psychological and physical safety and implement effective crisis prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. Domain 7: Family, School, and Community Collaboration: School psychologists understand principles and research related to family systems, strengths, needs, and cultures; evidence-based strategies to support positive family influences on children’s learning and mental health; and strategies to develop collaboration between families and schools. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, design, implement, and evaluate services that respond to culture and context. They facilitate family and school partnerships and interactions with community agencies to enhance academic and social–behavioral outcomes for children. Domain 8: Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populations: School psychologists have knowledge of individual differences, abilities, disabilities, and other diverse characteristics and the impact they have on development and learning. They also understand principles and research related to diversity in children, families, schools, and communities, including factors related to child development, religion, culture and cultural identity, race, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, socioeconomic status, and other variables. School psychologists implement evidence-based strategies to enhance services in both general and special education and address potential influences related to diversity. School psychologists demonstrate skills to provide professional services that promote effective functioning for individuals, families, and schools with diverse characteristics, cultures, and backgrounds through an ecological lens across multiple contexts. School psychologists recognize that equitable practices for diverse student populations, respect for diversity in development and learning, and advocacy for social justice are foundational to effective service delivery. While equality ensures that all children have the same access to general and special educational opportunities, equity ensures that each student receives what they need to benefit from these opportunities. Domain 9: Research and Evidence-Based Practice: School psychologists have knowledge of research design, statistics, measurement, and varied data collection and analysis techniques sufficient for understanding research, interpreting data, and evaluating programs in applied settings. As scientist practitioners, school psychologists evaluate and apply research as a foundation for service delivery and, in collaboration with others, use various techniques and technology resources for data collection, measurement, and analysis to support effective practices at the individual, group, and/or systems levels. Domain 10: Legal, Ethical, and Professional Practice: School psychologists have knowledge of the history and foundations of school psychology; multiple service models and methods; ethical, legal, and professional standards; and other factors related to professional identity and effective practice as school psychologists. School psychologists provide services consistent with ethical, legal, and professional standards; engage in responsive ethical and professional decision-making; collaborate with other professionals; and apply professional work characteristics needed for effective practice as school psychologists, including effective interpersonal skills, responsibility, adaptability, initiative, dependability, technological competence, advocacy skills, respect for human diversity, and a commitment to social justice and equity. Note: The domains and descriptions are from the 2020 NASP Standards and added to the Handbook in 2021. The 2010 NASP domains were used for all program requirements and evaluations in 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.

Provide Dr. Farmer with the supervisor’s name, title, and contact information by September 15. You and the supervisor must sign the PE agreement form. Students are matched and introduced early in the fall semester to finalize assignments and agreements. 12.1.7 Mid-Year Evaluation Evaluation At the end of the semester: - Submit your PE activity log - Your supervisor submits an evaluation form. Both items are due to the program director and are added to your program portfolio. 12.1.8 Additional Information No academic credit is awarded for this experience. The program does not require any readings, exams, or assignments beyond the log. While there are no assigned readings, your supervisor may ask you to read particular articles, chapters, or state regulations to improve your understanding during the experience. PE students may occasionally meet with school psychology faculty for discussion and reflection. 12.2 Practicum Experience Practicum experiences build on your foundational training by allowing you to apply developing skills in real-world settings. Across two sequenced placements—Assessment (Year 1) and Intervention/Consultation (Year 2), you will work in both school and clinic environments under close supervision. Practicum experiences are designed to support your integration of coursework with applied service delivery. 12.2.1 Overview Students in the MA/EdS program complete two practica prior to internship. These are designed to align with key phases of your training: Assessment Practicum Spring, Year 1 Taken alongside your assessment coursework. Course: PSYC 7614a – Practicum in School Psychology Consultation &amp; Intervention Practicum Fall &amp; Spring, Year 2 Taken alongside your intervention coursework. Course: PSYC 8614b – Practicum in School Psychology II Although the Consultation &amp; Intervention Practicum spans the entire second year, you only enroll in the corresponding course (PSYC 8614b) during the spring semester. The instructor will reach out to you regarding scheduling for meeting times in the fall and spring of the second year. In both Year 1 and Year 2, this means that formal enrollment in the practicum course occurs in the spring. Fieldwork may occur in a local school district, a partnering community agency, and/or in the department’s Psychological Services Center (PSC). The assessment practicum typically includes both school-based and PSC-based cases. The consultation and intervention practicum primarily takes place in schools and community agencies. Additional expectations are detailed in the respective course syllabi. 12.2.2 Supervision Practicum supervision is always provided by qualified faculty and/or credentialed community-based school psychologists. In the PSC, students receive individual and group supervision from program faculty. In school or community settings, supervision is coordinated with approval from the faculty supervisor, the on-site supervisor, and the student. Note: If you intend to pursue non-school licensure (e.g., as a Certified Psychological Assistant), the Tennessee Board of Examiners in Psychology requires supervision by a licensed Health Service Provider for relevant practicum or internship hours. 12.2.3 Evaluation Students are assigned a grade of Satisfactory (S), Unsatisfactory (U), or In Progress (IP) for each semester of practicum. In PSYC 7614A, supervisors rate students on professional behaviors, characteristics, and relevant NASP training domains. Clients served through the PSC also complete satisfaction measures. Progression to consultation and intervention practicum and coursework is contingent upon earning a Satisfactory (S) grade in the first-year practicum. Similar evaluations are conducted in PSYC 8614B, and a satisfactory grade is required to be eligible for internship. A syllabus is provided for both practica and outlines specific competencies, expectations, and evaluation criteria. 12.3 Internship Internship is the capstone field experience in the MA/EdS program. You will complete a full-time, year-long placement that meets national and state requirements for certification and licensure. Working under the supervision of a credentialed school psychologist, you will engage in all major domains of practice, including assessment, intervention, consultation, and systems-level work. Faculty will support you throughout the planning, application, and supervision process. During this time, you will be enrolled in PSYC 8812 which will provide you course credit for your internship experience. 12.3.1 Overview The internship is the culminating field experience in the MA/EdS program and must meet requirements set forth by: The Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE) The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) Internship placements must offer meaningful opportunities to serve diverse K–12 students and families in both regular and special education settings. All elements of the placement—supervision, setting, experiences, and facilities—must align with national training standards and program expectations. Internships are established through a formal agreement between the student, the program, and a local school district or approved agency. The Shelby County Schools system frequently takes students for internship, though in recent years opportunities for rural placement have become more frequent. 12.3.2 Internship Course (PSYC 8812) Internship is completed while enrolled in PSYC 8812: Internship in School Psychology, an entirely online graduate-level course that spans the final academic year of the program. Although you will spend your time in the field, you are still registered in a course and must meet academic requirements throughout the year. These include: Submitting mid- and end-of-year supervisor evaluations Maintaining an up-to-date internship hour log Completing and submitting two case studies (academic and behavioral) Completing a research or program evaluation project Participating in university check-ins, including one required on-campus meeting (typically in February) The standard enrollment is 3 credit hours in the fall and 3 credit hours in the spring for a total of 6 credit hours. Students who need to maintain full-time enrollment (e.g., for financial aid) may register for up to 12 credit hours. Regardless of credit hour enrollment, the internship must meet the same training standard: a full-time, supervised 1,200-hour experience consistent with NASP and program expectations. 12.3.3 Requirements Before selecting a site, students must consult with the program director and ensure all pre-internship requirements have been met. A full-time, 1,200-clock-hour experience At least 600 hours must be completed in a school setting, as required by NASP Supervised by a credentialed school psychologist Equivalent in scope to a 9-semester-hour academic load A formal Internship Plan template is provided to guide site selection, supervision, and training activities. Additional details and forms are available through the program director. 12.3.4 Evaluation of Internship Interns receive formal evaluations at both the midpoint and conclusion of the internship year. These evaluations are completed by the primary field-based supervisor and are submitted to the university program director. The purpose of these evaluations is to assess your progress toward competency in the domains of school psychology practice, to provide feedback for ongoing professional growth, and to support readiness for entry-level credentialing. The evaluation form used is aligned with NASP standards and program expectations, and includes ratings of your performance, strengths, and areas for continued development. In addition to supervisor ratings, you are expected to submit the following materials to your university supervisor by early April: One academic intervention case study One social-behavioral case study One research or program evaluation project completed during your internship These materials contribute to program assessment and may be included in documentation for accreditation purposes. If concerns arise at any point, supervisors are expected to contact the university program director promptly to address and resolve issues collaboratively. 12.3.5 Applying for Internship Students are responsible for seeking out and applying to internship placements independently, much like applying for a professional position. This process includes identifying appropriate sites, submitting application materials, and communicating with potential supervisors. Students are not limited to the state of Tennessee. Faculty will support you throughout this process by helping you evaluate site options, reviewing application materials, and ensuring that your selected placement meets program and NASP requirements. 12.3.6 Additional Resource: NASP Internship Toolkit The School Psychology Internship Toolkit from NASP is a free, comprehensive guide for graduate students preparing for internship. It includes practical guidance on securing placements, understanding supervision requirements, meeting national standards, and advocating for appropriate support. Students are encouraged to review this resource early in the internship planning process to ensure they understand expectations and best practices across different settings. 12.4 Logging Practicum and Internship Hours All students are required to log all hours completed during practicum and internship experiences. These logs must reflect the full scope of your activities, including direct services, indirect services, supervision, and other professional responsibilities. Practicum: Minimum of 600 total hours across the entire MAEDS program. Internship: Minimum of 1,200 total hours during the internship year. Accurate logging ensures your experiences meet NASP requirements and supports your eligibility for certification as a school psychologist after graduation. 12.4.0.1 Using the MAEDS Weekly Hours Log Workbook The MAEDS Weekly Hours Log Excel workbook is the required tool for tracking practicum and internship hours. It is designed to help you meet both the practicum and internship hour requirements: Practicum: Minimum of 600 total hours across the program.

These assessments support your growth, ensure readiness for advanced training, and uphold standards set by the program and accrediting bodies. 13.1 Advising and Academic Monitoring Progress is reviewed each semester during regular advising meetings: MA/EdS students are advised by Dr. Farmer. PhD students are advised by Dr. Meisinger. This advising applies to both degree-seeking and endorsement-only students. See the Policy Regarding Responsibility for Student Advising and the Policy for Periodic Evaluation of Students in Section III for additional details. 13.2 Course-Based and Embedded Assessments Every credit-bearing course—including practica and internships—contains embedded or outcome assessments, such as routine examinations, test-scoring reviews, case-study analyses, research reports, evaluations of readings or agency visits, in-class presentations, and supervisor evaluations during field experiences. Together, these provide an ongoing course-level review of students throughout the program. 13.3 Annual Review and Portfolio All students are formally reviewed by faculty at least once per year (usually in June). This annual review supplements semesterly advising and includes both academic and personal progress. Students submit their portfolio in advance, organized with the Student Evaluation and Performance Portfolio Summary (SEPPS) form and aligned with NASP competency domains. The review considers: course grades and assessments, practicum or internship evaluations, supervisor and faculty ratings, portfolio documentation of growth, and professional dispositions. Different forms are used for MA/EdS students and doctoral students; interns are exempt. Refer to Appendix A and the Policy for Periodic Evaluation of Students in Section III for details. 13.4 Field-Based Evaluation During all practicum and internship placements, site supervisors evaluate students with standardized forms aligned to NASP competencies: midway and at the end of each practicum, at the midpoint and end of internship, and within case-study and research-project evaluations (internship only). Students also complete self-evaluations and maintain logs, which are filed in their portfolio. 13.5 Ethics and MA Comprehensive Examination At the end of the first year, students complete the Ethics and Professional Standards Examination (administered in Canvas). The exam focuses on the NASP Principles for Professional Ethics, the APA Ethics Code (when applicable), and relevant state-level guidelines. This ethics review constitutes the written component of the MA comprehensive examination, typically taken in the fall semester of the second year. Successful completion of the MA exam is required for progression to EdS candidacy. Upon completion of MA requirements, students must submit: the MA Comprehensive Examination Form (filed by the Program Director), the EdS Program of Studies and Candidacy Form, and the Graduate School Change of Status Form. Students who plan to terminate at the MA degree may be subject to a standalone written exam. See Policy for MA and EdS Specialty Examinations in Section III. 13.6 Praxis Examination in School Psychology (ETS 5403) To fulfill the EdS written-examination requirement, students must take the Praxis II Examination in School Psychology and earn a score meeting the Tennessee Department of Education’s credentialing threshold (currently 147). Take the exam in late fall or early spring of the internship year. Preparation materials are available through NASP, ETS, and on campus (consult the Program Director). Praxis scores must be submitted to both the program and relevant state licensing agencies. A passing score is required for EdS degree conferral. 13.7 Licensure Recommendation and Program Completion When all academic, fieldwork, and assessment requirements are met, the Program Director submits: the TDOE Licensure Recommendation Form, and supporting documentation to the Office of Teacher Education &amp; Student Support Services (College of Education). Students pursuing out-of-state credentials should begin gathering required materials well before graduation. 13.8 Post-Degree Evaluation and Feedback The program gathers informal and formal feedback from alumni and employers—often through surveys—to monitor graduate performance and inform ongoing program improvement.

While students in the PhD program engage in intensive research training, MA/EdS students are also encouraged to participate through various means, including: Attending meetings of the Child and Family Studies Research Group Voluntary involvement in research labs Research responsibilities through assistantship assignments 14.1.2 Child and Family Studies Research Group All school psychology students are affiliated with the Child and Family Studies Research Group, which meets during the fall and spring semesters. MA/EdS students are strongly encouraged, but not required, to attend these meetings. If needed to meet full-time status requirements, students may enroll in: PSYC 7619: Research Practicum – Child and Family Studies Note: Credit hours earned in this course do not count toward degree requirements. 14.1.3 Voluntary Participation MA/EdS students frequently volunteer to work on research projects led by faculty or fellow students. These projects may take place on campus, in local schools, or within community agencies. Students considering doctoral study are especially encouraged to gain voluntary research experience. 14.1.4 Research and Teaching Assistantships Some MA/EdS students are offered graduate assistantships involving research and/or teaching. Assistantship appointments typically range from 10 to 20 hours per week. Compensation and tuition waiver eligibility vary by assignment and funding availability. 14.1.5 Thesis and Dissertation Only doctoral program students are required to complete a research thesis (MS) and a dissertation (PhD). MA/EdS students are not required to complete a thesis. Students who previously completed a thesis at another institution must have it reviewed for departmental acceptance. MA/EdS students who may transition to a doctoral program are encouraged to complete a thesis during their time in the program. Detailed requirements for theses and dissertations are outlined in the Graduate Program Handbook (link to be added). Last updated: August 13, 2025 "],["sppc.html", "15 The School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC) 15.1 SPPC Policies &amp; Procedures", " 15 The School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC) Starting with the fall semester, 2015, the SPPC replaced the former School Psychology Coordinating Committee that governed the MA/EdS Program from 1976-2015. The SPPC governs both the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD programs. The committee members are: Dr. Ryan Farmer (Chair) Dr. Randy Floyd Dr. Beth Meisinger Dr. Emily Srisarajivakul Dr. Michelle Washington Dr. Steve Zanskas (College of Education representative) 15.1 SPPC Policies &amp; Procedures Created August 17, 2015 Updated June, 2025 The School Psychology Coordinating Committee (SPCC) was originally established in 1975 by the Vice president for Academic Affairs to develop policy and curriculum for a jointly sponsored school psychology graduate program. The committee had representation from both the Department of Psychology (College of Arts and Sciences) and the College of Education. The original committee was appointed jointly by the Chair of the Psychology Department and by the Dean of the College of Education. The Chair and the Dean were granted joint overall authority for the School Psychology Program. Originally charged with the task of developing a program approval proposal to be submitted to the Tennessee State Department of Education, the committee’s efforts resulted in the development of the present program. At a meeting of July 7, 2015 it was recommended that the SPCC be reconstituted and that the MA/EdS program be brought into the governance of the Department of Psychology with the support of the College of Education via a revised committee structure. The original SPCC, comprised of four persons from the Psychology Department, four persons from the COE, with one person from each administrative unit designated as co-director of the program, and student representation will cease to exist, effective at the beginning of the fall semester, 2015. The new governing committee will be titled The School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC). The committee will govern the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD degree programs. The MA/EdS program will no longer be considered as jointly sponsored but rather will include curricula and policies that are developed by the core school psychology faculty and a dean’s office level representative of the College of Education. In 2021-2022 the SPPC will include Drs. Ryan Farmer (Director of the MA/EdS Program), Beth Meisinger (Director of the PhD Program), Randy Floyd (Psychology Department Chair), Ryan Farmer (Clinical Assistant Professor and Director of the Psychological Services Center), Emily Srisarajivakul (Assistant Professor), and (Dr. Steve Zanskas, Dean’s Faculty Fellow for the College of Education. Student members as needed will be asked to participate on the SPPC. Like the former SPCC’s authority over the MA/EdS degree program, the SPPC has policy authority over the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD degree programs. The committee ensures that its policies are consistent with the policies of the Department of Psychology while maintaining the necessary adaptations enacted in the past for the EdS degree governed by the College of Education (e.g., 30 semester hours beyond the MA degree including the internship and requirements of the overall sequence as approved by the SPPC). The following policies apply to the committee: 15.1.1 Establishment of the SPPC The SPPC shall consist of the following persons: The core faculty of the school psychology program from the Department of Psychology, to include faculty whose primary assignment is to the MA/EdS and the PhD programs; in effect, all members of the school psychology core faculty.  A representative from the College of Education’s administration selected by the Dean of the COE and approved by the core school psychology faculty.  This is usually a dean’s office level person with broad understanding of the COE.  At the discretion of the Dean, this person may be drawn from the areas of special education, educational psychology, or counseling. Students (e.g., from the MA/EdS level and the PhD levels of the program) may be asked to participate in the SPPC governance. The students will serve as ad hoc members, called upon as needed by the SPPC.  Faculty member vacancies are replaced in a timely fashion through the same process as the original selection procedure (see A-1-a &amp; b, and A-2).  One or more practicing school psychologists may be asked to participate in the SPPC governance. These professionals will serve as ad hoc members, called upon as needed by the SPPC. The SPPC requires a continuity of membership from year to year. Faculty selected to serve on the SPPC shall be expected to serve throughout their terms of appointment by the Department of Psychology or the College of Education. A core school psychology faculty member may choose not to serve for reasons acceptable to the SPPC and at the discretion of the SPPC a faculty member from another area of the Department of Psychology or the College of Education may be chosen to serve in that person’s stead. The SPPC Chair shall rotate annually between the MA/EdS and PhD program directors, beginning with the MA/EdS director in 2015. A history of the SPPC chair is provided in Figure 15.1. Figure 15.1: Timeline of MA/EdS Program Faculty. 15.1.2 Operating Procedures Meeting Times &amp; Minutes The SPPC shall meet at least once during each academic semester, excluding summer sessions. The meetings may be conducted through email or other electronic means. Meeting times and dates are established by the SPPC Chair in consultation with the members of the SPPC Meeting locations will usually be in the Department of Psychology but may be held in the COE at the discretion of the committee. The SPPC Chair shall announce the meeting, establish the agenda, and conduct the meeting. Minutes of meetings are recorded by the SPPC Chair (or by a designated committee member). Minutes are disseminated and maintained by the SPPC Chair. Business Topics The following represent the type of business that may be brought before the committee, though the committee is not limited to these examples: program admission policies or decisions retention or dismissal of students special appeals or petitions prepared by students curriculum policy decisions such as course additions, deletions, and substitutions (not to include day-to-day matters such as waivers) selection of subcommittee members (e.g., admissions) policies of the SPPC accreditation responsibilities of program faculty Decision-Making Policies The presence of any three members, including the Chair and two faculty shall constitute a quorum. The committee attempts to reach decisions by consensus, avoiding the necessity of formal votes. In situations where clear consensus cannot be reached, a vote may be requested by any committee member. A simple majority of the voting members of the committee present at the meeting shall determine the decision. Each faculty member of the SPPC has equal voting power (1 vote). Student ad hoc members shall neither be present nor vote on deliberations related to fellow students currently enrolled in the program (e.g., examination results, appeals, retention decisions). Ultimate responsibility for the operation of the program rests with the Chair of the Department of Psychology and policy decisions regarding the program are subject to such review. Subcommittees A Subcommittee on Admissions shall be established each year as per the policy on admissions. If needed, a Subcommittee on Examinations shall be established as per the policy on examinations. Additional subcommittees shall be established as judged appropriate by the SPPC. Changes to these policies This governance document is reviewed annually to ensure that new policies and amendments to the document have been included. These policies may be temporarily suspended by the proper motion, second, and affirmative vote of two-thirds of a quorum present at a SPPC meeting; or the policies may be permanently changed by the proper motion, second, and affirmative vote of two-thirds of the SPPC’s eligible voting members.

Membership on the subcommittee includes at least three members of the core faculty of the program and the COE representative. The MA/EdS Director (or other designee) serves as the subcommittee chair and oversees the receipt of applications and filing of decisions of the subcommittee. Each subcommittee member reviews and evaluates every applicant; application reviews may be conducted by email with applicant descriptions circulated to the subcommittee by the program director. Admission Standards: A. The admissions criteria for both the MA and EdS degrees include: - Undergraduate overall GPA of 3.00 (consideration will be given to applicants with GPA in range of 2.50-2.99). - GRE scores will no longer be required. - Three letters of recommendation from persons familiar with the applicant’s work. - The applicant must have completed at least 18 semester hours in psychology and/or education courses. - Completion of appropriate application forms. - Submission of undergraduate and/or graduate transcripts B. Students must complete the entire MA/EdS sequence or its equivalent for TDOE licensure endorsement. C. Admission to the EdS degree level is contingent upon successful completion of all MA requirements in school psychology (or their equivalent), successful completion of any oral and/or written comprehensive examinations at the end of the MA sequence, and completion of appropriate form(s) for the program and Graduate School (these include the EdS Program of Studies and Candidacy Form and the Graduate School’s Change of Status form). A student holding a master’s degree from another university and desiring entrance to the EdS level must satisfy the above requirements for entrance to the EdS. Deadlines: Students are admitted only into the fall semester. The admissions deadline is established by the MA/EdS Director. There are two deadlines for admission: Early Consideration is March 5th and Regular Consideration is May 1st. Applications will be reviewed in the 2-3 weeks following the deadline and students will be notified of their acceptance within 2-3 weeks following review of applications. Students admitted for fall may enter in the summer semester (SPPC Minutes, 3/5/98). It is the student’s responsibility to assure that all materials related to admission have been filed. Diversity: The program is sensitive to the need for greater cultural and ethnic diversity in the statewide and nationwide delivery of school psychological services and is committed to actively recruiting a diverse student population to assist in meeting this need. In accordance with overall University policy, the admissions process does not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or lifestyle choice. 16.2 Policy Regarding Responsibility for Student Advising in the MA/EdS Program in School Psychology (Effective 1998-1999; updated May 2002, July 2013, June 2014, June 2015, July 2021) School psychology program advising is primarily about academic requirements for degree completion. However, students are also expected to seek advising on related matters such as employment and credentialing, advanced graduate studies, personal development, and program evaluation. Advising sessions should be held with the student’s advisor at least once per semester. Advising is provided throughout the period from application to completion of all degree requirements. The student’s advisor maintains a file on each advisee which is updated as part of the periodic student advising process. The program faculty members are also available to assist students throughout the period of internship and as needed during the early years of their career. Each student has a primary advisor with whom he/she works. Only in the absence of the primary advisor should students seek the advisement of other program faculty. Students enrolled in the Master of Arts (MA) program are advised by the program MA/EdS director or by the director’s designee from among the core school psychology faculty. Currently, MA students have as their primary advisor Dr. Ryan Farmer with the assistance of Drs. Randy Floyd or Beth Meisinger. Students in the Educational Specialist degree (EdS) program have as their primary advisor, Dr. Ryan Farmer, Director of the MA/EdS Program who collaborates with the designated person in the College of Education (COE, currently, Dr. Steve Zanskas, Dean’s Faculty Fellow for the college), for the advising of students in the EdS degree sequence. The COE person assists the student in completing application and degree completion materials. The MA/EdS program director advises the student on course requirements and assists in completing the student’s degree plan. The degree plan is approved by the director and COE person, both of whom also serve as the student’s committee. The MA/EdS director maintains a file on each student enrolled in the program which is updated as part of the periodic student evaluation process. A permanent file of graduates is also maintained by the Psychology Department. Non-degree, licensure endorsement students are advised by the MA/EdS program director who files a proposed endorsement program with the Teacher Licensure Office (COE) for initial approval and an endorsement recommendation after the student has completed all requirements. As faculty members of the Department of Psychology, the director and core program faculty may have advisory responsibilities for undergraduate psychology majors. The Director of the MA/EdS Program also confers with prospective students seeking a career in school psychology. 16.3 Policy Regarding Residency in the MA/EdS Program In School Psychology Regular and intensive pursuit of the School Psychology Program are expected of all students. Though no formal non-doctoral residency requirements exist at The University of Memphis, the MA/EdS program requires the student to pursue studies in consecutive semesters until finished, and to enroll in a minimum of nine (9-12) semester hours each semester; students often complete 3 to 6 hours across the summer sessions. The nine hours may include enrollment for credit in the Child, Adolescent, and Family Studies meetings and/or the Professional Experience; however, these credits are not counted as part of the overall MA/EdS program). Exceptions to the policy are made in instances where the student’s remaining courses and experiences do not require nine hours of enrollment, or by special circumstances receiving the approval of the MA/EdS Director. (See Minutes of SPCC, March 5, 1998) Recognizing the importance of traditional and emerging instructional methodologies for the completion of curriculum requirements, the program will allow up to 4 courses (typically 12 sem. hrs.) of on-line learning to be applied to the entire 60-66 hr. MA/EdS requirement. The online course(s) must receive prior approval of the MA/EdS Director for students enrolled in the program, or approval at the time of program entrance for online courses already completed. Online courses will not be approved for core courses (PSYC 7/8800 courses) and field experiences including practica and internship. This policy will be reviewed periodically as a means of keeping up to date with online offerings and the need for flexibility in training practices. 16.4 Policy for the Periodic Evaluation of Students in the School Psychology Program The periodic evaluation of students is important to judging their progress and that of the program. Periodic evaluation sessions identify student strengths and weaknesses as they relate to their success as school psychologists. The evaluations also provide the opportunity to establish short- and long-range goals for continued professional development and to acquire specific career information. In addition, periodic evaluations provide the opportunity to establish short- and long-range goals for program development and delivery. Thus, periodic evaluation is a two-way process providing information related to both student and program development. The following shall guide the periodic evaluation process: Periodic evaluation sessions are held with each student individually at least once per year during his/her enrollment in the program. Sessions are scheduled by the MA/EdS Director and include as many as possible of the other program faculty and the College of Education representative. First and second year students are formally evaluated following the spring semester, usually at meetings scheduled in May or June. The session should review, but not be limited to the following: the student’s academic progress in courses including grades, specific skills (e.g., report writing, case management), and conceptual development; the advisor’s judgment of the student’s personal-social behavior as related to the practice of school psychology; the student’s perception of his/her academic and personal progress and overall suitability to the field of school psychology; the student’s perception of the overall quality of program instruction, supervision, and administration; an overall summary of the student’s progress toward degree completion, a recommendation for internship, and eventual endorsement for licensure. The general format of the review is guided by the Student Evaluation and Performance Portfolio Summary (SEPPS) (see p. 39-40; Appendix A) which reviews progress in all areas related to the program’s goals that are derived from NASP’s training competency areas. The SEPPS is included with the student’s portfolio at the time of the session that is subsequently rated by the faculty. The SEPPS Form and Guidelines for its Completion are made available to students in advance of each annual review. Following the session, student progress is rated by the faculty and a summary sheet prepared and provided to the student. A copy of the summary is maintained by the MA/EdS Director. At meetings of the School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC), the Director of the MA/EdS Program shall report on the overall status of the students based on their periodic evaluations. The SPPC may choose to meet with a student to clarify evaluation information or to conduct an appeal of the student’s evaluation. Students whose progress in one or more areas is judged to be unsatisfactory by both the primary advisor and the MA/EdS Director may appeal the judgment to the SPPC. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the student to make a written request to the Director of the MA/EdS Program for an appeal including a brief justification for the appeal. The request must be submitted within two weeks of the student’s receipt of the Director of the MA/EdS Program’s evaluation summary. In turn, the Director of the MA/EdS Program will schedule an appeal meeting with the SPPC or subcommittee thereof, at which the student must appear. The SPPC may choose to affirm the judgment of the Director of the MA/EdS Program, reverse the judgment of the Director of the MA/EdS Program, or table the matter for further investigation and consideration. In so doing, the SPPC may choose to add or delete specific recommendations/objectives established during the previous evaluation sessions with the primary advisor and the Director of the MA/EdS Program. Additional sessions are generally conducted in conjunction with the student’s regular academic advising for registration each semester. It is the responsibility of the student to schedule an advising session each semester with the primary advisor. Interns are evaluated through separate procedures at mid-year and at the end of the internship. 16.5 Policy for Receiving a Recommendation to and Completing the EdS Level Internship in School Psychology (Revised July, 2008; Updated, 2012, 2013, 2015) The school psychology internship is the culminating experience for the EdS degree. Appearing at or near the end of the training program, the internship is entered only by students who are adequately prepared to meet its demands. Students may neither seek nor enter an internship without the approval of the Director of the MA/EdS Program. If a student enters an internship without the Director of the MA/EdS Program’s approval, the program will not participate in the intern’s supervision, nor will the experience be considered as fulfilling the internship requirement for degree completion or licensure endorsement. A recommendation to enter an internship is made by the MA/EdS Director. The student must meet all the following requirements: - The student is in good academic standing, maintaining a minimum 3.00 GPA for all graduate level work applicable to the school psychology MA/EdS sequence at the time of entering the internship. - The student has received a grade of “B” or better in all assessment classes as prerequisite to entering any practica. The student must have received a satisfactory grade (S) in all practica. The practica must be completed prior to entering the internship. - Except in cases of externship (where the internship is spread over two academic years), the student should have completed all other program requirements prior to entering the internship. With approval of the Director of the MA/EdS Program, a student may complete no more than two courses during the internship period. Students may not enter the internship if more than two courses remain to be taken in addition to the internship. - The student has been judged to be making satisfactory progress in all areas during the most recent periodic evaluation review. - The student, with the assistance of the MA/EdS Director, has located an internship site and a plan of internship has been prepared which conforms to NASP standards. The Director of the MA/EdS Program’s approval of the plan represents formal approval for the student to enter the internship. - The intern is not employed full-time in any other capacity with the host internship agency or school district. Students should initiate their search for an internship at least six months in advance of its starting date. The MA/EdS Director grants approval to seek an internship only when the following requirements have been met: - The student is in good academic standing, maintaining a minimum 3.00 GPA for all graduate level work applicable to the school psychology MA/EdS sequence. - The student has completed at least 48 of the 54 pre-internship hours required in the program. - NOTE: Students on assistantship, who are required to maintain enrollment for 9 sem. hrs. each semester, and whose tuition is waived, may enroll for internship in advance of starting the internship when their schedules can accommodate this. The “in progress” (IP) grade is maintained until the internship is completed in the regular manner. Permission of the MA/EdS Director is required. - The student has been judged to be making satisfactory progress in all areas during the most recent periodic evaluation review. Recommendation letters from the Director of the MA/EdS Program and other faculty are expected to be a part of the student’s application for an internship. The Director of the MA/EdS Program’s letter of recommendation is required and represents the Director of the MA/EdS Program’s approval to seek an internship. Internship experiences are designed to be in accord with the training and field placement standards of the National Association of School Psychologists. The experience is a minimum of 1200 clock hours, at least half of which is completed in a school setting. The internship, and the intern’s expected period of service, extends across the entire school year. The experience is not considered to have been completed simply on the basis of 1200 hours of satisfactory service. The internship is completed only when the agency/district-based supervisor provides a final evaluation of satisfactory completion to the MA/EdS Director. On the basis of the supervisor’s letter, the results of on-campus and on-site meetings, and any other evaluation information, the Director of the MA/EdS Program records a final grade for the student (Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory). The student must receive a satisfactory (S) grade for the internship in order to complete the program requirements and receive licensure endorsement. 16.6 Policy for the MA and EdS Specialty Examinations (Revised 2006, Updated 2007, Revised July 2013, Update June 2015) It is the philosophy of the School Psychology Program to prepare individuals who fulfill the Tennessee Department of Education requirements for licensure as a school psychologist, and who will perform competently on the job. The specialty examination is one means of quality control related to this objective. The specialty examination assists both faculty and students in determining apparent strengths and weaknesses related to program goals. Though a student may be terminated for poor performance on the examination, in general it is the purpose of the examination to provide a means toward improving the student’s overall competence. The specialty examination attempts to evaluate the student’s understanding of his/her studies and skills related to the practice of school psychology. At the MA level, students must complete a written examination if continuing into the EdS level or if terminating at the MA level. All EdS level students complete a written comprehensive examination, typically the ETS Praxis Exam in School Psychology. 16.6.1 Guidelines for the MA Examination The exam is conducted with each student individually in the semester during which the student plans to complete the MA degree. The student must be in good academic standing and judged to have made satisfactory academic and personal progress in the program. The exam is related to the legal and ethical aspects of school psychology and students are typically provided one or more situations to which they must respond. The exam and the student response may be conveyed by email. Responses are evaluated as “Pass-Fail” by the person administering the exam, which is usually the MA/EdS Director. Following the examination, the student’s performance is reported to the student and the MA/EdS Director conveys the results on the appropriate examination form to the Graduate School. 16.6.2 Guidelines for the EdS Examination Beginning in 2006, the ETS Praxis Exam in School Psychology was substituted for the traditional written comprehensive examination. The examination requirement consists of both written and oral components. The written component is the ETS Praxis Exam in School Psychology. The oral component is integrated with the February intern visit to campus during which we discuss your evaluation of the program and our evaluation of your internship. In order to complete the EdS examination requirement, each student must submit an acceptable score for school psychology credentialing by the Tennessee Department of Education (currently 147 since 2014). The student will not be approved to receive the EdS degree without an acceptable score on the Praxis examination in school psychology. 16.6.2.1 Procedure Each student must submit to the MA/EdS Director an official written documentation of his or her acceptable Praxis score no later than one week before the Graduate School deadline for submitting comprehensive examination scores for graduation in that semester. Because the ETS refuses to send official scores to individuals (e.g., the MA/EdS Director), the student is permitted to provide a photocopy of his/her official personal results notice. The student may take the Praxis exam more than once according to the schedule set by ETS. It is recommended that students take the exam late in the first semester or early in the second semester of the internship. If the student’s score is not acceptable by the deadline for that semester, the student will be required to repeat the Praxis examination and submit an acceptable score in time for graduation and at the end of the next semester. 16.6.2.2 Exception For students who for whatever reason are not completing the internship but seeking to complete the EdS by substitute course work (which is very rare), they would be required to take a traditional written examination at a scheduled time during the semester in which he or she plans to graduate. - The student must be in good academic standing and judged to have made satisfactory academic and personal progress in the program, including the internship. - The exam covers the content of the MA/EdS degree sequences, and may consider the student’s academic and personal progress, the student’s assessment of career goals, and the student’s evaluation of the program. - The examination consists of at least six essay items, developed by a subcommittee of at least two program faculty. - Following the examination, each subcommittee member reads the entire exam, votes on the student’s performance on each item, and makes an overall rating of the student’s performance on the exam. - The ratings are gathered and recorded by the MA/EdS Director. In cases where the ratings are considerably discrepant, the Director of the MA/EdS Program will establish a meeting of the examination committee to determine an overall rating on the exam; this meeting may include a discussion with the student. Following the meeting, the committee will decide (by majority vote) if the student has passed the examination. Where ratings are in close agreement, the Director of the MA/EdS Program conveys to the student the overall rating (Pass/Fail) on the exam. Students failing either the MA or the EdS traditional written examination may apply to take the examination a second and final time in the semester following the first administration. Failure on the second administration will result in dismissal from the program. 16.7 School Psychology Program at the University of Memphis – Licensure Recommendation Requirements Degree: The Educational Specialist or higher degree (or its equivalent) including preparation specifically in school psychology. A recommendation is made only when the applicant has completed all requirements of The University of Memphis MA/EdS program or the equivalent. A person seeking licensure endorsement who has prior degrees and/or licensure from outside Tennessee will have requirements determined individually to be equivalent to the training level of the licensure requirements specified below. The review is done by the MA/EdS school psychology program coordinator. 16.8 Policy and Procedure for the Endorsement of Non-Degree School Psychology Licensure Students (Effective 1998-1999, Update July, 2013) Occasionally persons seek the assistance of the program in achieving licensure after moving to Tennessee from out of state where they were trained and/or practiced as school psychologists, or after completing degrees in fields other than school psychology. Persons already holding a credential as a school psychologist in another state are directed to seek licensure reciprocity directly through the licensure office in the TDOE. As a TDOE approved program, the University of Memphis School Psychology Program endorses for TDOE licensure only persons who have completed the MA/EdS approved program or its equivalent. The following policies shall be applied to this process: - The Director of the MA/EdS Program holds a preliminary meeting with the person to make a judgment of the person’s admissibility to the program and to review previous work. The Director of the MA/EdS Program advises the person as to what will be required for admission to the program as a degree or non-degree student, and also provides a judgment regarding additional work required for endorsement. If the person concurs and chooses to go forward with the process, he/she then submits an application to enter the program as a degree or non-degree student. - The applicant’s previous work shall be reviewed by the MA/EdS Director to determine what additional courses and experiences are required to reach program equivalency. In some instance, this will require enough additional work that the applicant will be asked to enroll in the MA and/or EdS degree programs. In other instances where only a few additional requirements remain, the applicant may choose to be admitted as a non-degree student. - A time limit for previous work is not imposed. However, the burden rests with the applicant to demonstrate that his/her knowledge and skills are commensurate with the expectations for current students. In the absence of such demonstration, required courses and experiences must be repeated. Competency may be achieved through repeating courses or experiences, obtaining credit by examination, validation of previous courses, presenting letters attesting to one’s skills, or actual demonstration of skills through practicum. - In the process of achieving program equivalency, the person must make regular application to the program and be admitted according to the guidelines for degree seeking program students. - In addition to the usual application materials (university and departmental application forms, GRE scores, all undergraduate and graduate transcripts), the person must submit letters from previous faculty, employers, or others familiar with his/her work. - The application must include information regarding relevant education and psychology credentials already held. - The application is reviewed through the regular admission subcommittee process. If admitted to the program, the student’s degree/non-degree requirements for endorsement are reviewed again by the COE program co-director. - Once admitted, the student must pursue required courses and experiences according to the residency policy. The student’s work is reviewed each semester as per the policy for periodic review. - If the student is completing the MA and/or the EdS degree, he or she must complete the required annual review sessions and pass the corresponding written examination requirements. - Once the student’s requirements are completed, the student will file for endorsement through the Office of Teacher Education &amp; Student Support Services of the CO and the MA/EdS Director will file the final review form, as is customary for other students. - Note: Students with prior work almost always complete the EdS degree enroute to endorsement. Thus, although the program provides for the endorsement training of students already holding an EdS or greater degree or its equivalent, it is a very rare occasion. 16.9 Responsibilities of the Director of the MA/EdS School Psychology Program (Effective 1998-1999, Updated July 2013, June 2015) The day-to-day operation of the School Psychology Program is administered from the Department of Psychology. The director of the MA/EdS School Psychology Program is an academic appointment in the Department of Psychology, and the position is filled according to the policies and procedures of the Department of Psychology. Matters of retention, tenure and promotion are also determined by the Department of Psychology. The MA/EdS director serves as the principal representative of that program to the School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC). All matters related to the development, maintenance, and operation of the program are determined by the SPPC and directed to the MA/EdS director for appropriate action. The director represents the MA/EdS program to several constituencies including the Department of Psychology, the COE, the general university community, the Tennessee Department of Education, accreditors, other university programs, practicum and internship sites, community agencies, and the general public. The director serves as a member of the SPPC. In this capacity, the director brings important matters before the SPPC. As the official policy making body of the program, the SPPC resolves business and establishes policies that are then put into effect by the MA/EdS director. Responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the program is delegated to the MA/EdS director by the SPPC. Specific functions related to day-to-day operation include: - Recruitment of students. This may include developing program descriptions and brochures for dissemination, visitations to other colleges and universities, career advising of potential students. - With assistance of the Admission’s Secretary in the Department of Psychology, the director screens all incoming applications, removing those that do not meet minimal expectations for further review by the admissions subcommittee. Those worthy of review are forwarded by the director to the subcommittee for review, and the subcommittee’s decisions are processed by the Admissions Secretary to the Graduate Office. - Reviewing program policies, curricular requirements and electives, and making recommendations for improvement to the SPPC. - Assists in advising students currently enrolled in the program as per the policy on advising. - Conducts follow-up evaluations of previous graduates, especially those in the most recent years. These evaluations are used to assist in program development. - Assists students in seeking and selecting suitable practicum, internship, and employment sites. - Assists students in seeking advanced graduate programs. - Maintains the necessary records of the program including: - correspondence with prospective students, field placement sites, practitioners, other programs, TDOE, TASP, etc. - folders of current and former students - degree plans for each student - program policies, descriptions, minutes of meetings - MA and EdS examinations, results, records - historical information about the program - accreditation records - Oversee the preparation and grading of MA and EdS exams. - Establishing and maintaining liaison relationships to various agencies. This is a central responsibility of the day-to-day operation of the program. This includes relationships with the various constituencies identified in the first paragraph above. 16.10 Policy on Student Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools (Effective July 2025) 16.10.1 Purpose and Scope This policy outlines expectations for the ethical, appropriate, and legally compliant use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools by students in the MA/EdS program. These expectations apply across all domains of training, including academic work, clinical practice, and research. While the program recognizes the educational potential of AI tools—particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini—student use must reflect the professional values of school psychology and comply with ethical and legal standards, particularly those related to client confidentiality and academic integrity. Students are responsible for the content of all academic, clinical, and research work they submit, regardless of whether AI tools were used. Any work supported by AI must be critically reviewed, edited, and appropriately attributed. AI tools must not replace the student’s own academic writing, clinical reasoning, or research decision-making. Students are encouraged to consult with faculty or supervisors before using AI tools in any new or uncertain context. Students should recognize that AI tools can generate inaccurate, outdated, or biased content and must critically evaluate all AI-supported output. Students are also encouraged to consider the level of risk associated with AI use. For example, high-risk uses involve personal or client information and are strictly prohibited; low-risk uses (like grammar checks on non-clinical documents) are permitted with disclosure. Faculty are encouraged to model ethical AI use in their instruction and provide explicit guidance in their syllabi regarding appropriate and inappropriate use. The program also recognizes that AI tools may serve as assistive technology for students with documented disabilities. In such cases, students may request approval to use AI tools as a support, provided the use aligns with accessibility goals and institutional policies. 16.10.2 Confidentiality and Client Information Under no circumstances should students enter information about real clients into AI tools that are not institutionally approved. This includes both identified and de-identified clinical material. Most publicly available AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) are not HIPAA- or FERPA-compliant, and their use to process clinical information constitutes a serious breach of ethical and legal standards. Students may not use AI tools to draft psychological reports, treatment plans, clinical notes, or emails involving client material. 16.10.3 Academic Use AI tools may be used in coursework with instructor permission and within the following guidelines: Permitted uses include outlining, grammar checking, brainstorming, tabulation of information, reviewing APA formatting, or for assessing or improving tone. Students should not submit AI-generated content as their own. This prohibition includes using AI tools to generate citations and references. When AI tools are used to assist with academic work submitted to a course instructor as an assignment or in meeting a program milestone, students must include a brief note of disclosure indicating when and how the tools were used. For example: &gt; “Portions of this paper were assisted using ChatGPT on July 7, 2025 for outlining and grammar checking. All written content reflects the student’s own original work.” Other use of AI tools for any assignments or exams is not permitted unless explicitly approved by the instructor. 16.10.4 Clinical Use Given the ethical and legal responsibilities associated with practicum and internship placements, students may not use AI tools to support clinical casework. Specifically: Students should not input clinical, client-related, or school-based case material into AI tools. AI tools may not be used to write, revise, or summarize psychological reports or clinical notes. AI tools may not be used to simulate counseling, create behavior management plans, or generate diagnostic impressions, even hypothetically, unless part of a structured educational activity involving no real client data. Students may use AI tools to explore academic content related to school psychology (e.g., reviewing intervention strategies or theoretical frameworks), provided that no client information is included. Students may also use AI to help them improve templates or to generate suggestions related to a general referral concern (e.g., identifying evidence-based reading fluency interventions), but they must not include specific case details. 16.10.5 Research Use Students may use AI tools in research for specific, transparent purposes with research advisor approval. Appropriate uses include summarizing existing literature, checking grammar, outlining ideas, tabulating results, or assisting with coding tasks in concert with human review. This is not a complete list due to the evolving nature of AI. Consult with your research advisor and/or committee when unsure. Students should not replace their own critical thinking processes, including integrating content, with AI. AI tools must not be used to fabricate, manipulate, or analyze data. Any use of AI in theses, papers, presentations, or other work products must be disclosed. Students may not enter identifiable or sensitive data into AI systems. See the sections on (a) Confidentiality and Client Information and (b) Clinical Use. 16.10.6 Violations Misuse of AI tools may result in remediation, academic discipline, or removal from practicum or internship settings, depending on the severity of the situation. Repeated or serious violations may lead to dismissal from the program. "],["sippolicy.html", "17 Policy on Student Intervention Plans and Grievance Procedures 17.1 Purpose and Scope 17.2 When a Student Intervention Plan is Required 17.3 Content of the Student Intervention Plan 17.4 Student Responsibilities 17.5 Consequences for Non-Compliance 17.6 Grievance Procedures 17.7 Gross Misconduct", " 17 Policy on Student Intervention Plans and Grievance Procedures (Effective August 2025) 17.1 Purpose and Scope This policy outlines the procedures for implementing and monitoring student intervention plans (SIPs) in the MA/EdS program, including when they are required, what they must contain, expectations for student compliance, and the process for addressing grievances. The goal is to support student success while maintaining the academic, clinical, and professional standards of the program. This policy applies to all enrolled students and covers academic performance, clinical competencies, professional conduct, and adherence to ethical standards. 17.2 When a Student Intervention Plan is Required A SIP will be initiated when a student’s academic, clinical, or professional performance falls below program expectations, or when conduct is inconsistent with the values and standards of the school psychology profession. Examples include, but are not limited to: Academic performance falling below the minimum GPA or course grade requirements. Failure to meet practicum or internship performance standards. Deficiencies in professional behavior, communication, or ethical decision-making. Violations of program or university policies. Concerns about fitness to practice raised by faculty, supervisors, or field-based partners. The decision to initiate a SIP will be made by the Program Director in consultation with core faculty and/or the student’s practicum/internship supervisor. 17.3 Content of the Student Intervention Plan Each SIP will: Identify the specific concern(s) and the standard(s) not met. Outline measurable goals for improvement. Detail required actions and resources (e.g., mentoring, supplemental training, additional supervision). Specify a timeline for completion. Identify methods for evaluating progress. State potential consequences for non-compliance. The plan will be documented in writing, signed by the student, Program Director, and any relevant supervisors. 17.4 Student Responsibilities Students are expected to: Fully engage with all requirements of the SIP. Maintain open and timely communication with faculty and supervisors. Complete all assigned activities and submit requested documentation by deadlines. Demonstrate ongoing progress toward SIP goals. 17.5 Consequences for Non-Compliance Failure to meet the terms of the SIP may result in escalating consequences, up to and including: Extension or revision of the SIP. Reduction or removal from practicum or internship placements. Academic probation. Recommendation for dismissal from the program. The severity of the consequence will reflect the seriousness of the concern and the student’s responsiveness to remediation efforts. 17.6 Grievance Procedures Students have the right to grieve decisions related to SIPs, academic standing, or conduct concerns. The grievance process is as follows: Informal Resolution – Students are encouraged to discuss concerns directly with the faculty member, supervisor, or Program Director as soon as possible. Written Grievance – If the matter is not resolved informally, the student may submit a written grievance to the Program Director within 10 business days of the decision or action being contested. Program Review – The Program Director will convene a review committee of at least two core faculty members to evaluate the grievance and render a decision. Appeal – If dissatisfied with the review committee’s decision, the student may appeal in writing to the Department Chair within 10 business days. The Chair’s decision is final at the departmental level. University Procedures – Students may pursue further appeals through the university’s formal grievance channels as outlined in the Graduate Catalog. 17.7 Gross Misconduct Certain behaviors constitute gross misconduct and may result in immediate suspension from clinical duties or recommendation for dismissal without an intervention plan. Examples include: Breaches of confidentiality involving client information. Falsification of academic, clinical, or research records. Harassment, discrimination, or other violations of university conduct policies. Behavior that places clients, peers, or supervisors at risk of harm. Gross misconduct will be reviewed by the Program Director and faculty, and may also be referred to the university’s Office of Student Conduct.
