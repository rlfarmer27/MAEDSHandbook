While school-clinical psychology offerings and an MA degree program were available during the period 1960-1975, a jointly sponsored MA/EdS program (Department of Psychology and COE) was formally initiated in 1976. It was an outgrowth of changes in the requirements for Tennessee State Department of Education certification (now licensure) of school psychologists in Tennessee (circa 1975) and the need for a revised school psychology program at what was then called Memphis State University. The revised program, a 45 semester hour MA degree, was developed by a School Psychology Coordinating Committee (SPCC), established at the request of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. The SPCC functioned as the policy-making body for the jointly sponsored MA/EdS program until August 2015. The new MA program was the first instance of a school psychology specific degree and the hiring of faculty in the area of school psychology. Dr. Thomas Fagan, the first bona fide school psychologist faculty member, was hired for the 1976-1977 school year. Dr. Bruce Bracken joined the faculty in 1986 and left in 1999. Dr. Wendy Naumann served from 1998-2001. Dr. Randy Floyd joined the program in fall 2001, Dr. Robin Phaneuf served from 2002-2006 and Dr. Laura Casey served in her position on an interim basis in 2006-2007 as a visiting assistant professor. Dr. Elizabeth Meisinger joined the faculty in fall 2007 and Dr. Xu (Lilya) Jiang joined the faculty in fall 2015 and left in June 2020. Dr. Sarah Irby was hired as a clinical assistant professor in fall 2020 and in fall 2021 was appointed interim director of the MA/EdS program when Dr. Fagan retired as an emeritus professor in August 2021. Drs. Emily Srisarajivakul and Ryan Farmer joined the faculty in fall 2022. Dr. Ryan Farmer assumed the role of director of the MA/EdS program in fall 2023. Dr. Sarah Irby left the faculty in spring 2024. Dr. Michelle Washington joined the faculty in Fall 2024. Drs. Meisinger, Srisarajivakul, Washington, Farmer, and Floyd currently constitute the core program faculty and are supported by faculty in other areas of the Psychology Department, the COE, and local practitioners who assist with instruction and field supervision. Faculty appointment history is displayed in figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: Timeline of MA/EdS Program Faculty. ``` Administered from the Psychology Department, the jointly sponsored MA/EdS program was indirectly overseen by the Dean of the COE and the Chair of the Psychology Department. The MA/EdS program was governed by a 10-member School Psychology Coordinating Committee (SPCC; 4 members chosen from Psychology, 4 chosen from the COE, and 2 students). All policies and curricula related to this program were the responsibility of the committee and were implemented by the MA/EdS program Director. The Associate Dean for Graduate Studies served as the program’s primary contact in the COE. The SPCC developed a set of policy statements for the program as well as the original 45 semester hour Master’s degree in 1975-1976 and the revised versions of those policies appear in this Handbook. The current 60-66 semester hour combined MA/EdS degree curriculum was initiated in 1982; the one-school year internship requirement was part of the EdS having previously been one semester. The PhD program was initiated in 1991 but governed by the policies of the Psychology Department’s PhD major. Program curricula and requirements for the different programs (MA/EdS and PhD) were determined entirely by the SPCC and by the Psychology Department, respectively. Starting in the fall of 2014, the directorship of the two programs was split with Dr. Fagan continuing as the director of the MA/EdS program and Dr. Floyd assuming the directorship of the PhD program. The programs continued to overlap in several areas of the curriculum and other areas (e.g., School Psychology Association, SPCC representation, field placements). In the summer of 2015 at a meeting of the core faculty with the UM Provost, the Interim Dean of the College of Education, and the chair of the Department of Psychology, it was agreed to restructure the governance of the MA/EdS program by drawing it into the governance of the Psychology Department. A revised School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC) was created to oversee the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD programs. The 2015 restructured governance arrangement retains the separate directorships, and the chair of the SPPC rotates among the two directors. The revised structure appears in this Handbook in Section III: Program Policies, Chapter 8 for more details. With the change in governance, some changes were also made to the curriculum. For several years the program struggled to have certain courses in the COE offered on a regular basis and/or to focus the content more toward the needs of the school psychology students. This was especially true of courses in counseling theory and academic interventions. With the addition of a fourth school psychology faculty member, it was feasible to shift the content of those intervention courses into the core sequence of school psychology (7/8800 courses). Additional optional courses were also recommended in some areas (e.g., research design) and two intervention electives from counseling, special education, and educational psychology were added. The revised curriculum was in effect for students entering in fall, 2016 through spring 2025. In fall, 2025, minor adjustments to the curriculum were made to account for changes within the College of Education that impact course availability. Those changes are reflection in Section II: Program Description, Chapter 7 for more details. The MA/EdS program has been accredited by NASP/NCATE (now CAEP) since the 1970s and first received NCATE/NASP approval in 1988. This approval has been uninterrupted and is active through December 2024. In 2024, the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) was recognized by the Council for Higher Education as an accrediting organization in 2023. The program’s first self study and site visit for accreditation with NASP was completed during the 2024-2025 academic year; results are anticipated in fall 2025. Accreditation of the PhD program from the American Psychological Association was awarded in fall, 2014 and is active until 2021 (extended due to COVID-19 pandemic); the program’s accreditation was renewed in spring, 2024 and is active until 2034.

The primary mission of the Department of Psychology is to advance the science and profession of psychology through the production and dissemination of knowledge related to the discipline, and the preparation of academic and professional psychologists. Consistent with the mission of the Center for Applied Psychological Research (CAPR), departmental emphasis is placed upon scholarly activities which maintain and enhance the department’s national research reputation. The department strives to provide high quality liberal and general education for undergraduate students, a coherent, high-quality program for its majors and graduate students, service courses to students in other majors, and services to the general public. The breadth of the faculty’s commitment is reflected in graduate programs in both basic and applied science and in diverse research and scholarly pursuits. The department’s mission is consistent with the university’s mission to advance learning through excellence in teaching, research, and service. In 2020-2021 the department employed 22 full-time and 10 Non-Tenure-Track faculty (including adjuncts), and 24 full-time office staff including the Institute for Intelligent Systems (IIS) and the Psychological Services Center (PSC). History and Degrees: Psychology was established as an independent department in 1947. Authorization to award the master’s degree was granted in 1960 and the first such degree was granted in 1962. The Ph.D. program in psychology was begun in 1966. For fall semester 2021 there were 112 students enrolled: There were 40 doctoral students in clinical, 12 in experimental, and 15 in school psychology. There were 29 students enrolled in the Master of Science in General Psychology (MSGP) and 16 in the Master of Arts/Educational Specialist in School Psychology (MA/EdS) Program. Graduate students have a voice in policy and decision-making through elected representatives to the department, and students are full members of several committees in the department. The training program in clinical psychology has been continuously accredited by the American Psychological Association since 1972. The MA/EdS program in school psychology has been continuously NASP approved since 1988. The PhD school psychology program was accredited by the APA in fall, 2014. More detailed history about the program is available in Chapter 2. Facilities: The Department of Psychology occupies a building of 88,000 square feet on the main University campus. This four-story structure contains two complete floors of animal and human research laboratories allowing all types of psychological investigation, a clinic (Psychological Services Center), undergraduate laboratories, a data analysis center, classrooms, and offices for all Psychology Department faculty and full-time graduate students. Classrooms are modern and equipped with computer, projection equipment, and internet access. The department’s laboratories and clinic are outfitted completely with modern equipment sufficient for faculty or student research or training activities. Additional space exists in the nearby FedEx Institute of Technology Bldg. The University maintains a modern computer center with numerous networked connections in the Department of Psychology. Student access to this system is readily available. The department owns many network-connected computers. Wireless internet access is available to faculty and students in all campus instructional buildings. The department also houses two computer laboratories that are used for both research and teaching. Online and distance learning facilities have expanded to meet the needs of continued instruction and business operations during the pandemic. The Psychological Services Center (PSC). The PSC at the University of Memphis offers a wide range of services to the university and the public. The Center is the training and service delivery unit of the Psychology Department’s graduate programs in clinical and school psychology. Psychological and psychoeducational assessment, consultation, and intervention services are available by graduate students and advanced Ph.D. candidates who are directly supervised by clinical and school psychologists from the Memphis community and the University faculty. Center of Excellence. Founded in 1984, the Center for Applied Psychological Research (CAPR) is one of the original Tennessee Centers of Excellence, now designated an Accomplished Center of Excellence. The CAPR faculty have attracted millions of dollars in extramural funding to the State of Tennessee, published hundreds of scholarly works, graduated hundreds of masters and doctoral students and many times that number of undergraduates, been elected or appointed to many national professional offices, and won numerous local and national honors and awards. The primary CAPR goals are (a) to achieve national prominence for its accomplishments, (b) to increase the number of trained psychologists able to conduct, disseminate, and apply such research, and (c) to secure extramural funding to facilitate research and training. In addition, as part of a Psychology Department in a major urban research university, CAPR supports the general teaching, research, and service missions of the department and university. Center funds are also used to sponsor major conferences that allow top psychologists from this country and throughout the world to visit our department. The primary mission of the Center for Applied Psychological Research (CAPR) at The University of Memphis is to support psychological research. As part of a major urban research university, a primary focus of this mission is the application of psychological knowledge to finding solutions to individual and social problems – local, regional, and national. Therefore, CAPR research focuses extensively on problems concerning health, mental health, education, schools, crime, the environment, and children and their families. In addition, to increasing our capacity for generating new approaches to applied problems, CAPR also supports basic scientific research in cognitive psychology, biopsychology, social psychology, developmental psychology, and research design and statistics. Collaboration: Faculty and graduate students conduct research and work on collaborative service projects in numerous community agencies, including the Desoto County Schools, Shelby County Schools, the municipal school districts of Arlington, Bartlett, Collierville, Germantown, Lakeland, and Millington, area charter schools and the Achievement School Districts including the ASPIRE Schools; Shelby County Head Start, the Boling Developmental Disabilities Center, the Veterans Administration Medical Center, the Departments of Psychiatry, Community Medicine, Pediatrics and Preventive Medicine at the University of Tennessee-Center for the Health Sciences-Memphis, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, the Memphis Mental Health Institute, agencies and departments of the City of Memphis, the University’s Center for Student Development and Disability Resources for Students, and several community agencies. Administrators of these agencies are receptive to making their facilities and subject populations available for diverse psychological research projects and clinical services. Several distinguished scholars in psychology and related areas visit the department each year to present colloquia and workshops to faculty and students. The speakers represent a variety of current subject matter areas within psychology and have contributed to the Department’s Diversity Series held across the academic year. Additionally, the local chapters of Sigma Xi and other campus and community groups often invite scholars in psychology and related disciplines to Memphis. Research Areas: The faculty, students, and programs are spread over 5 research areas: Behavioral Neuroscience; Child and Family Studies; Clinical Health Psychology; Cognitive Psychology; and Psychotherapy Research. All faculty and students in the school psychology programs are affiliated with the Child and Family Studies area. The Child, Adolescent, and Family Studies (CAFS) Research Area. CAFS includes faculty and students from several department programs including Child Clinical Psychology, Developmental Psychology, and School Psychology and represents all three of the department’s doctoral degree concentrations (Clinical, Experimental, and School). The common core of faculty research interests is a commitment to examining age-related cognitive, cultural, emotional, health, and social factors across infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Basic and applied research projects are conducted in a variety of settings, including community agencies, day care and preschool programs, homes, hospitals, and schools. From this diversity across faculty interests, graduate students can construct individualized programs of study and be involved with a wide variety of research topics and populations. CFS faculty have teaching assignments to courses related to the research area, and many provide supervised practicum experiences through the department’s Psychological Services Center. Colloquium meetings are scheduled as needed on Friday afternoons during which faculty, students, and community partners present research findings.

The SPPC governs both the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD programs. The committee members are: Dr. Ryan Farmer (Chair) Dr. Randy Floyd Dr. Beth Meisinger Dr. Emily Srisarajivakul Dr. Michelle Washington Dr. Steve Zanskas (College of Education representative) 8.1 SPPC Policies &amp; Procedures Created August 17, 2015 Updated June, 2025 The School Psychology Coordinating Committee (SPCC) was originally established in 1975 by the Vice president for Academic Affairs to develop policy and curriculum for a jointly sponsored school psychology graduate program. The committee had representation from both the Department of Psychology (College of Arts and Sciences) and the College of Education. The original committee was appointed jointly by the Chair of the Psychology Department and by the Dean of the College of Education. The Chair and the Dean were granted joint overall authority for the School Psychology Program. Originally charged with the task of developing a program approval proposal to be submitted to the Tennessee State Department of Education, the committee’s efforts resulted in the development of the present program. At a meeting of July 7, 2015 it was recommended that the SPCC be reconstituted and that the MA/EdS program be brought into the governance of the Department of Psychology with the support of the College of Education via a revised committee structure. The original SPCC, comprised of four persons from the Psychology Department, four persons from the COE, with one person from each administrative unit designated as co-director of the program, and student representation will cease to exist, effective at the beginning of the fall semester, 2015. The new governing committee will be titled The School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC). The committee will govern the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD degree programs. The MA/EdS program will no longer be considered as jointly sponsored but rather will include curricula and policies that are developed by the core school psychology faculty and a dean’s office level representative of the College of Education. In 2021-2022 the SPPC will include Drs. Ryan Farmer (Director of the MA/EdS Program), Beth Meisinger (Director of the PhD Program), Randy Floyd (Psychology Department Chair), Ryan Farmer (Clinical Assistant Professor and Director of the Psychological Services Center), Emily Srisarajivakul (Assistant Professor), and (Dr. Steve Zanskas, Dean’s Faculty Fellow for the College of Education. Student members as needed will be asked to participate on the SPPC. Like the former SPCC’s authority over the MA/EdS degree program, the SPPC has policy authority over the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD degree programs. The committee ensures that its policies are consistent with the policies of the Department of Psychology while maintaining the necessary adaptations enacted in the past for the EdS degree governed by the College of Education (e.g., 30 semester hours beyond the MA degree including the internship and requirements of the overall sequence as approved by the SPPC). The following policies apply to the committee: 8.1.1 Establishment of the SPPC The SPPC shall consist of the following persons: The core faculty of the school psychology program from the Department of Psychology, to include faculty whose primary assignment is to the MA/EdS and the PhD programs; in effect, all members of the school psychology core faculty.  A representative from the College of Education’s administration selected by the Dean of the COE and approved by the core school psychology faculty.  This is usually a dean’s office level person with broad understanding of the COE.  At the discretion of the Dean, this person may be drawn from the areas of special education, educational psychology, or counseling. Students (e.g., from the MA/EdS level and the PhD levels of the program) may be asked to participate in the SPPC governance. The students will serve as ad hoc members, called upon as needed by the SPPC.  Faculty member vacancies are replaced in a timely fashion through the same process as the original selection procedure (see A-1-a &amp; b, and A-2).  One or more practicing school psychologists may be asked to participate in the SPPC governance. These professionals will serve as ad hoc members, called upon as needed by the SPPC. The SPPC requires a continuity of membership from year to year. Faculty selected to serve on the SPPC shall be expected to serve throughout their terms of appointment by the Department of Psychology or the College of Education. A core school psychology faculty member may choose not to serve for reasons acceptable to the SPPC and at the discretion of the SPPC a faculty member from another area of the Department of Psychology or the College of Education may be chosen to serve in that person’s stead. The SPPC Chair shall rotate annually between the MA/EdS and PhD program directors, beginning with the MA/EdS director in 2015. A history of the SPPC chair is provided in Figure 8.1. Figure 8.1: Timeline of MA/EdS Program Faculty. 8.1.2 Operating Procedures Meeting Times &amp; Minutes The SPPC shall meet at least once during each academic semester, excluding summer sessions. The meetings may be conducted through email or other electronic means. Meeting times and dates are established by the SPPC Chair in consultation with the members of the SPPC Meeting locations will usually be in the Department of Psychology but may be held in the COE at the discretion of the committee. The SPPC Chair shall announce the meeting, establish the agenda, and conduct the meeting. Minutes of meetings are recorded by the SPPC Chair (or by a designated committee member). Minutes are disseminated and maintained by the SPPC Chair. Business Topics The following represent the type of business that may be brought before the committee, though the committee is not limited to these examples: program admission policies or decisions retention or dismissal of students special appeals or petitions prepared by students curriculum policy decisions such as course additions, deletions, and substitutions (not to include day-to-day matters such as waivers) selection of subcommittee members (e.g., admissions) policies of the SPPC accreditation responsibilities of program faculty Decision-Making Policies The presence of any three members, including the Chair and two faculty shall constitute a quorum. The committee attempts to reach decisions by consensus, avoiding the necessity of formal votes. In situations where clear consensus cannot be reached, a vote may be requested by any committee member. A simple majority of the voting members of the committee present at the meeting shall determine the decision. Each faculty member of the SPPC has equal voting power (1 vote). Student ad hoc members shall neither be present nor vote on deliberations related to fellow students currently enrolled in the program (e.g., examination results, appeals, retention decisions). Ultimate responsibility for the operation of the program rests with the Chair of the Department of Psychology and policy decisions regarding the program are subject to such review. Subcommittees A Subcommittee on Admissions shall be established each year as per the policy on admissions. If needed, a Subcommittee on Examinations shall be established as per the policy on examinations. Additional subcommittees shall be established as judged appropriate by the SPPC. Changes to these policies This governance document is reviewed annually to ensure that new policies and amendments to the document have been included. These policies may be temporarily suspended by the proper motion, second, and affirmative vote of two-thirds of a quorum present at a SPPC meeting; or the policies may be permanently changed by the proper motion, second, and affirmative vote of two-thirds of the SPPC’s eligible voting members.
