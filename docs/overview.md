# Program Overview {#overview}

The School Psychology Program at the University of Memphis prepares graduate students to become competent, ethical, and effective school psychologists. Through integrated coursework, closely supervised fieldwork, and a strong emphasis on applied research, the program develops professionals who are equipped to serve diverse children, families, and schools.

## Mission and Values

The mission of the MA/EdS Program in School Psychology is to prepare graduates who are ready to provide evidence-based, culturally responsive services to children, families, and schools. Grounded in the scientist-practitioner model, the program emphasizes critical thinking, professional ethics, and collaborative problem-solving.

We are committed to:
- Equitable service delivery across diverse settings  
- Developing professional skills through real-world experience  
- Supporting the well-being and learning of all children  
- Upholding the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct  
- Preparing students for long-term success in practice or doctoral-level study  

## Degrees Awarded

Students who complete the program earn the following degrees:
- Master of Arts (MA) in Psychology
- Education Specialist (EdS) in School Psychology

These degrees are awarded concurrently, and both are required for program completion and credentialing.

## Relationship with the Doctoral Program 

Students in the MA/EdS program take many of their courses alongside students in the School Psychology doctoral program. This shared coursework fosters collaboration, shared learning, and familiarity with advanced topics in the field. Furthermore, the majority of *applied* skills for doctoral-level school psychologists are the same as those required of MA/EdS-level practitioners, especially in areas such as assessment, consultation, and intervention.

MA/EdS students are also welcome to participate in faculty research labs, attend research group meetings, and pursue additional research experience beyond program requirements. These opportunities are especially encouraged for students considering future doctoral study.

Students interested in continuing into the doctoral program may apply directly from the MA/EdS program. While acceptance is not automatic, many MA/EdS students have successfully transitioned into the doctoral program. Requirements for the doctoral degree are maintained in a separate handbook, and prospective applicants are encouraged to speak with the program director for guidance on planning and application.

## Duration and Structure

The program is designed as a **three-year, full-time sequence**:
- **Years 1–2**: Campus-based coursework, practicum experiences, and research activities
- **Year 3**: Full-time internship in an approved school or community-based setting

Students begin field experiences during their first semester and build toward increasingly independent practice under supervision. A minimum of 60 semester credit hours is required for graduation.

## NASP Approval

The MA/EdS Program in School Psychology has been *approved by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP)* since 1998. The program most recently hosted a site visit as part of its regular review cycle and is currently awaiting updated approval results.

Graduates of NASP-approved programs are eligible to apply for the *Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP)* credential.

## Accreditation and State Approval

The University of Memphis is fully accredited by the *Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)*.

The School Psychology Program is also consistent with guidelines from the Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE), and graduates meet the educational requirements for licensure as a school psychologist in Tennessee and many other states.

If you are planning to practice in a state other than Tennessee, please consult with the program director and review that state’s licensure guidelines.

## Admission Requirements {#admissionreq}
The criteria for admission to the MA/EdS and the PhD programs appear in the UM Graduate Bulletin and include quantitative and qualitative measures. No single measure is used in making a decision.  Rather, the entire application file is reviewed to make a judgment of a student’s probable success in training to become a school psychologist.  See also the Policy for Admission to the MA/EdS Program in this handbook, in Section III.  Some students apply to the program as non-degree students seeking only admission to complete the work necessary for an endorsement for state department of education credentialing.  These applications are reviewed against the usual admission requirements and ensure that appropriate degrees and work have already been satisfactorily completed, The Policy for Endorsement of Non-Degree School Psychology Licensure Students is also available in Section III. **For the time being, the program is not reviewing requests for non-degree school psychology licensure.**

## Advising {@advising}
Student progress is reviewed during regular advising each semester. This applies to degree and endorsement only students. The policies regarding Responsibility for Student Advising and for Periodic Evaluation of Students are both present in Section III. Policies for the advising of doctoral students are covered in the doctoral handbook. Dr. Farmer serves as the primary advisor for MA/EdS students and Dr. Meisinger for the PhD students.
