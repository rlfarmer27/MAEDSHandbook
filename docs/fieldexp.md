# Field Experiences {#fieldexp}

As part of your training in the MA/EdS program, you will complete a sequence of field experiences designed to build your readiness for advanced practice. These include:

- **Professional Experience (PE)** — early exposure and observation  
- **Practicum 1** — focused on assessment skills  
- **Practicum 2** — focused on consultation and intervention  
- **Internship** — a full-time placement during your final year (described in its own section)  

The table below summarizes key details for the first three experiences:

| **Type**        | **When**              | **Primary Activities**                    | **Time Commitment**   | **Campus Supervisor**     |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| PE             | Fall, Year 1          | Shadowing and general school exposure     | 4 hours per week       | Dr. Farmer                 |
| Practicum 1    | Spring, Year 1        | Assessment in schools and PSC             | 4 hours per week       | Dr. Washington             |
| Practicum 2    | Fall & Spring, Year 2 | Consultation and intervention             | 4 hours per week       | Dr. Srisarajivakul         |

Each experience is designed to complement your coursework and is supervised by qualified school psychologists or affiliated professionals.

Students sometimes worry about whether they are accumulating enough hours. If you complete an average of 4 hours per week for 14 weeks each semester, you will log approximately 56 hours per semester. Across PE, Practicum 1, and Practicum 2, this results in a total of 224 hours during your time on campus. **The program expects a minimum of 200 hours** across the professional experience and practicum experiences.

Internship is calculated separately and follows NASP’s explicit guidance on time and supervision. We’ll cover those expectations in more detail in the \@ref(internship) section.

### Required Background Checks

The following information has been copied from the [College of Education website: http://www.memphis.edu/ tep/clinical/background-checks.php](http://www.memphis.edu/ tep/clinical/background-checks.php)\
All students needing to obtain field experience hours for courses are required to have a TBI Background Check cleared and on file in the College of Education's Office of Teacher Education and Student Support Services. Read the procedures for obtaining a background check at the College of Education website and follow them closely.

### Required Liability Insurance

Students engaged in external practicum placements or external research projects are required to carry student liability insurance. The Psychology Department purchases a group student liability policy on an annual basis. Dr. Meisinger will email documentation regarding this policy to students each fall semester. Students should retain a copy of this documentation for their own records.


## Professional Experience {#profexp}

### Overview  
The **Professional Experience (PE)** takes place during the first fall semester in which you are enrolled on campus. It serves as an early field placement to help you become familiar with school environments and the role of the school psychologist.

You will volunteer approximately **half a day per week** (or equivalent) in a local school under the supervision of a credentialed school psychologist. The total time commitment is typically **50–60 hours** over the course of the semester.

### Schedule & Coordination  
You and the assigned school psychologist will determine your schedule, location, and activities. A formal agreement outlining the placement is signed by both parties and kept on file.  

- The experience begins the week after Labor Day and follows the University of Memphis academic calendar for the fall semester.  
- You are **expected to serve during fall break** but are **not required to serve during Thanksgiving week**.  
- You may not exceed one full day per week of service unless approved in advance by the program director and your on-site supervisor.  

### Supervision & Documentation  
You are required to maintain a log of your activities throughout the semester. This log should be submitted to the program director at the end of the fall term as a standalone document. You will be provided with a log to use for this purpose.

Your supervising school psychologist will also complete a brief performance evaluation which will be submitted online. Both documents become part of your program record.

### Purpose  
The Professional Experience introduces you to:

- The structure and function of public and private school systems  
- The role of the school psychologist within educational and community contexts  
- How school-based psychological services are delivered  

This early placement provides the foundation for your practicum work in the spring semester (PSYC 7614A: Practicum in School Psychology).

### Typical Activities  

You will engage in activities suited to your training level and arranged collaboratively with your mentor. While not all activities must be completed, your log should document what you did, when, and for how long.

#### Building Level  
- Attend a school-based support team or staff meeting

### Assignment & Shelby County Procedure  
After consulting with the program director, you will be matched with a credentialed school psychologist for supervision. Provide Dr. Farmer with the supervisor’s name, title, and contact information by September 15. You and the supervisor must sign the PE agreement form.

Students are matched and introduced early in the fall semester to finalize assignments and agreements.  

### Mid-Year Evaluation Evaluation  
At the end of the semester:
- Submit your PE activity log  
- Your supervisor submits an evaluation form.  

Both items are due to the program director and are added to your program portfolio.

### Additional Information  
- No academic credit is awarded for this experience.  
- The program does not require any readings, exams, or assignments beyond the log.  
- While there are no assigned readings, your supervisor may ask you to read particular articles, chapters, or state regulations to improve your understanding during the experience.
- PE students may occasionally meet with school psychology faculty for discussion and reflection.

## Practicum Experience {#practicum}

Practicum experiences build on your foundational training by allowing you to apply developing skills in real-world settings. Across two sequenced placements—Assessment (Year 1) and Intervention/Consultation (Year 2), you will work in both school and clinic environments under close supervision. Practicum experiences are designed to support your integration of coursework with applied service delivery.

### Overview  
Students in the MA/EdS program complete two practica prior to internship. These are designed to align with key phases of your training:

- **Assessment Practicum**  
  *Spring, Year 1*  
  Taken alongside your assessment coursework.  
  - **Course:** PSYC 7614a – Practicum in School Psychology
\
\
- **Consultation & Intervention Practicum**  
  *Fall & Spring, Year 2*  
  Taken alongside your intervention coursework.  
  - **Course:** PSYC 8614b – Practicum in School Psychology II

Although the Consultation & Intervention Practicum spans the entire second year, you only enroll in the corresponding course (PSYC 8614b) during the spring semester. The instructor will reach out to you regarding scheduling for meeting times in the fall and spring of the second year. In both Year 1 and Year 2, this means that formal enrollment in the practicum course occurs in the spring.

Fieldwork may occur in a local school district, a partnering community agency, and/or in the department’s *[Psychological Services Center (PSC)](https://www.memphis.edu/psc)*. The assessment practicum typically includes both school-based and PSC-based cases. The consultation and intervention practicum primarily takes place in schools and community agencies. Additional expectations are detailed in the respective course syllabi.

### Supervision  
Practicum supervision is always provided by qualified faculty and/or credentialed community-based school psychologists.  

- In the PSC, students receive individual and group supervision from program faculty.  
- In school or community settings, supervision is coordinated with approval from the faculty supervisor, the on-site supervisor, and the student.  

> **Note:** If you intend to pursue **non-school licensure** (e.g., as a *Certified Psychological Assistant*), the Tennessee Board of Examiners in Psychology requires supervision by a licensed Health Service Provider for relevant practicum or internship hours.

### Evaluation  
Students are assigned a grade of **Satisfactory (S)**, **Unsatisfactory (U)**, or **In Progress (IP)** for each semester of practicum.  

In **PSYC 7614A**, supervisors rate students on professional behaviors, characteristics, and relevant **NASP training domains**. Clients served through the PSC also complete satisfaction measures.  

Progression to **consultation and intervention practicum and coursework** is contingent upon earning a **Satisfactory (S)** grade in the first-year practicum. Similar evaluations are conducted in PSYC 8614B, and a satisfactory grade is required to be eligible for internship.  

A syllabus is provided for both practica and outlines specific competencies, expectations, and evaluation criteria.

## Internship {#internship}

Internship is the capstone field experience in the MA/EdS program. You will complete a full-time, year-long placement that meets national and state requirements for certification and licensure. Working under the supervision of a credentialed school psychologist, you will engage in all major domains of practice, including assessment, intervention, consultation, and systems-level work. Faculty will support you throughout the planning, application, and supervision process. During this time, you will be enrolled in PSYC 8812 which will provide you course credit for your internship experience.

### Overview  
The internship is the culminating field experience in the MA/EdS program and must meet requirements set forth by:

- The Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE)  
- The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP)  

Internship placements must offer meaningful opportunities to serve diverse K–12 students and families in both regular and special education settings. All elements of the placement—supervision, setting, experiences, and facilities—must align with national training standards and program expectations.

Internships are established through a formal agreement between the student, the program, and a local school district or approved agency. The Shelby County Schools system frequently takes students for internship, though in recent years opportunities for rural placement have become more frequent.

### Internship Course (PSYC 8812)

Internship is completed while enrolled in PSYC 8812: Internship in School Psychology, an entirely online graduate-level course that spans the final academic year of the program. Although you will spend  your time in the field, you are still registered in a course and must meet academic requirements throughout the year. These include:

- Submitting mid- and end-of-year supervisor evaluations  
- Maintaining an up-to-date internship hour log  
- Completing and submitting two case studies (academic and behavioral)  
- Completing a research or program evaluation project  
- Participating in university check-ins, including one required on-campus meeting (typically in February)

The standard enrollment is **3 credit hours in the fall and 3 credit hours in the spring** for a total of 6 credit hours. Students who need to maintain full-time enrollment (e.g., for financial aid) may register for up to 12 credit hours. Regardless of credit hour enrollment, the internship must meet the same training standard: a full-time, supervised **1,200-hour experience** consistent with NASP and program expectations.

### Requirements  
Before selecting a site, students must consult with the program director and ensure all pre-internship requirements have been met.

- A full-time, **1,200-clock-hour** experience
  - At least 600 hours must be completed in a school setting, as required by NASP
- Supervised by a credentialed school psychologist  
- Equivalent in scope to a 9-semester-hour academic load

A formal Internship Plan template is provided to guide site selection, supervision, and training activities. Additional details and forms are available through the program director.

### Logging Internship Hours

You are required to log all hours completed across the entire internship year. This log should reflect the full scope of your activities, including direct services, indirect services, supervision, and other professional responsibilities.

Internship hours should be documented using the same log form used for practicum experiences. If you need a new copy of the form, please contact the program director or download it from the program resources folder.

Just as in practicum, your hour log will be submitted as part of your end-of-semester documentation and must be kept up to date throughout the year. Supervisors will also review and sign off on your logs as part of the evaluation process. This documentation helps ensure that your experience aligns with NASP’s 1,200-hour requirement and supports your eligibility for certification and licensure after graduation.

### Evaluation of Internship

Interns receive formal evaluations at both the midpoint and conclusion of the internship year. These evaluations are completed by the primary field-based supervisor and are submitted to the university program director.

The purpose of these evaluations is to assess your progress toward competency in the domains of school psychology practice, to provide feedback for ongoing professional growth, and to support readiness for entry-level credentialing. The evaluation form used is aligned with NASP standards and program expectations, and includes ratings of your performance, strengths, and areas for continued development.

In addition to supervisor ratings, you are expected to submit the following materials to your university supervisor by early April:

- One academic intervention case study  
- One social-behavioral case study  
- One research or program evaluation project completed during your internship  

These materials contribute to program assessment and may be included in documentation for accreditation purposes. 

If concerns arise at any point, supervisors are expected to contact the university program director promptly to address and resolve issues collaboratively.

### Applying for Internship

Students are responsible for seeking out and applying to internship placements independently, much like applying for a professional position. This process includes identifying appropriate sites, submitting application materials, and communicating with potential supervisors. Students are not limited to the state of Tennessee.

Faculty will support you throughout this process by helping you evaluate site options, reviewing application materials, and ensuring that your selected placement meets program and NASP requirements.

### Additional Resource: NASP Internship Toolkit

The [**School Psychology Internship Toolkit**](https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/graduate-students/the-school-psychology-internship-toolkit) from NASP is a free, comprehensive guide for graduate students preparing for internship. It includes practical guidance on securing placements, understanding supervision requirements, meeting national standards, and advocating for appropriate support.  

Students are encouraged to review this resource early in the internship planning process to ensure they understand expectations and best practices across different settings.
