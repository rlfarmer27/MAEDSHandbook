# Getting Started {#gettingstarted}

## Orientation and Mentorship

At the beginning of the program, you will attend a graduate orientation hosted by the Department of Psychology. This session provides key information about program expectations, university resources, and support services. Orientation is required for all incoming students.

In addition, the School Psychology Association (SPA) coordinates a peer mentorship program. Incoming students are paired with second-year students who can offer guidance, support, and insight during your first year of training.

Social gatherings and informal meetups are often scheduled around the start of the semester to help you get to know your cohort and student community.

## Campus Logistics

### Parking  
General student parking is included with your fees. You will receive a parking hangtag and may park in any designated general lots. The closest parking to the Psychology Building is typically Lot 40 on Innovation Drive.

### ID Cards  
You’ll need to obtain a University of Memphis ID card to access buildings and university services. ID cards are issued in the Wilder Tower lobby and are required for secure building entry, including the Psychology Building.

### Building Access and Safety  
The Psychology Building remains locked outside of standard business hours and requires card access. Red emergency phones are located in hallways throughout the building and connect directly to campus police.

The university also offers **Tiger Patrol** escort services from dusk until late evening. Call 901-678-HOME for safe escort between locations on campus.

## Graduate Assistantships

While the MA/EdS program does not guarantee assistantship funding, students are encouraged to seek opportunities across campus. Graduate assistantships may involve teaching, research, or student services roles and typically offer a tuition waiver and stipend.

Assistantships are posted by individual offices and programs. Students should inquire with their faculty mentors or explore postings on university job boards and departmental bulletin boards.

## Program Canvas Enrollment

All students in the School Psychology MA/EdS program are enrolled in a **Canvas shell** that serves as the central hub for important announcements, documents, and deadlines. Be sure to check Canvas regularly for updates, shared resources, and communication from faculty.

To self-enroll in the Canvas site, use this link: [https://memphis.instructure.com/enroll/JGKTRL](https://www.memphis.instructure.com/enroll/JGKTRL)

If you have trouble accessing the Canvas shell, contact the program director for assistance.

## Background Checks

Before beginning any field-based experience (including Professional Experience, practicum, and internship), you must complete a **TBI background check** through the College of Education. This is a university-wide requirement for anyone working in school settings.

Instructions for completing the background check are posted on the [College of Education’s Background Checks page](https://www.memphis.edu/tep/clinical/background-checks.php). Follow these instructions carefully and allow time for processing.

Once completed, confirmation is filed with the College of Education, and you may be asked to provide documentation when starting a school placement.
