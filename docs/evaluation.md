# Assessment and Evaluation of Student Progress {#evaluation}

Student progress in the **MA/EdS School Psychology** program is evaluated continuously through a combination of academic, field-based, and professional-development benchmarks. These assessments support your growth, ensure readiness for advanced training, and uphold standards set by the program and accrediting bodies.

## Advising and Academic Monitoring

Progress is reviewed each semester during regular advising meetings:

- **MA/EdS students** are advised by **Dr. Farmer**.  
- **PhD students** are advised by **Dr. Meisinger**.  

This advising applies to both degree-seeking and endorsement-only students. See the *Policy Regarding Responsibility for Student Advising* and the *Policy for Periodic Evaluation of Students* in Section III for additional details.

## Course-Based and Embedded Assessments

Every credit-bearing course—including practica and internships—contains embedded or outcome assessments, such as

- routine examinations,  
- test-scoring reviews,  
- case-study analyses,  
- research reports,  
- evaluations of readings or agency visits,  
- in-class presentations, and  
- supervisor evaluations during field experiences.

Together, these provide an ongoing course-level review of students throughout the program.

## Annual Review and Portfolio

All students are formally reviewed by faculty **at least once per year** (usually in June). This **annual review** supplements semesterly advising and includes both academic and personal progress. Students submit their **portfolio** in advance, organized with the *Student Evaluation and Performance Portfolio Summary (SEPPS)* form and aligned with NASP competency domains. The review considers:

- course grades and assessments,  
- practicum or internship evaluations,  
- supervisor and faculty ratings,  
- portfolio documentation of growth, and  
- professional dispositions.

Different forms are used for MA/EdS students and doctoral students; interns are exempt. Refer to *Appendix A* and the *Policy for Periodic Evaluation of Students* in Section III for details.

## Field-Based Evaluation

During all practicum and internship placements, site supervisors evaluate students with standardized forms aligned to NASP competencies:

- midway and at the end of **each practicum**,  
- at the midpoint and end of **internship**, and  
- within **case-study and research-project evaluations** (internship only).

Students also complete self-evaluations and maintain logs, which are filed in their portfolio.

## Ethics and MA Comprehensive Examination

At the end of the first year, students complete the **Ethics and Professional Standards Examination** (administered in Canvas). The exam focuses on

- the [NASP Principles for Professional Ethics](https://www.nasponline.org/standards-and-certification/professional-ethics),  
- the [APA Ethics Code](https://www.apa.org/ethics/code) (when applicable), and  
- relevant state-level guidelines.  

This ethics review constitutes **the written component** of the MA comprehensive examination, typically taken in the fall semester of the second year. Successful completion of the MA exam is required for progression to EdS candidacy.

Upon completion of MA requirements, students must submit:

- the **MA Comprehensive Examination Form** (filed by the Program Director),  
- the **EdS Program of Studies and Candidacy Form**, and  
- the **Graduate School Change of Status Form**.

Students who plan to terminate at the MA degree may be subject to a standalone written exam. See [Policy for MA and EdS Specialty Examinations](@specialtyexampolicy) in Section III.

## Praxis Examination in School Psychology (ETS 5403)

To fulfill the EdS written-examination requirement, students must take the Praxis II Examination in School Psychology and earn a score meeting the Tennessee Department of Education’s credentialing threshold (**currently 147**).

- Take the exam in **late fall or early spring** of the internship year.  
- Preparation materials are available through NASP, ETS, and on campus (consult the Program Director).  
- Praxis scores must be submitted to both the program and relevant state licensing agencies.  
- A passing score is required for EdS degree conferral.

## Licensure Recommendation and Program Completion

When all academic, fieldwork, and assessment requirements are met, the Program Director submits:

- the **TDOE Licensure Recommendation Form**, and  
- supporting documentation to the **Office of Teacher Education & Student Support Services** (College of Education).

Students pursuing out-of-state credentials should begin gathering required materials well before graduation.

## Post-Degree Evaluation and Feedback

The program gathers informal and formal feedback from alumni and employers—often through surveys—to monitor graduate performance and inform ongoing program improvement.
