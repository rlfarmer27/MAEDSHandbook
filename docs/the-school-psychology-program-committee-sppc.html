<p>Starting with the fall semester, 2015, the SPPC replaced the former
School Psychology Coordinating Committee that governed the MA/EdS
Program from 1976-2015. The SPPC governs both the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD
programs. The committee members are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Ryan Farmer (Chair)</li>
<li>Dr. Randy Floyd</li>
<li>Dr. Beth Meisinger</li>
<li>Dr. Emily Srisarajivakul</li>
<li>Dr. Michelle Washington</li>
<li>Dr. Steve Zanskas (College of Education representative)</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> SPPC Policies &amp; Procedures<a href="the-school-psychology-program-committee-sppc.html#sppc-policies-procedures" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>(August 17, 2015, updated June, 2025)</p>
<p>The School Psychology Coordinating Committee (SPCC) was originally
established in 1975 by the Vice president for Academic Affairs to
develop policy and curriculum for a jointly sponsored school psychology
graduate program. The committee had representation from both the
Department of Psychology (College of Arts and Sciences) and the College
of Education. The original committee was appointed jointly by the Chair
of the Psychology Department and by the Dean of the College of
Education. The Chair and the Dean were granted joint overall authority
for the School Psychology Program. Originally charged with the task of
developing a program approval proposal to be submitted to the Tennessee
State Department of Education, the committee’s efforts resulted in the
development of the present program. At a meeting of July 7, 2015 it was
recommended that the SPCC be reconstituted and that the MA/EdS program
be brought into the governance of the Department of Psychology with the
support of the College of Education via a revised committee structure.
The original SPCC, comprised of four persons from the Psychology
Department, four persons from the COE, with one person from each
administrative unit designated as co-director of the program, and
student representation will cease to exist, effective at the beginning
of the fall semester, 2015.</p>
<p>The new governing committee will be titled The School Psychology Program
Committee (SPPC). The committee will govern the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD
degree programs. The MA/EdS program will no longer be considered as
jointly sponsored but rather will include curricula and policies that
are developed by the core school psychology faculty and a dean’s office
level representative of the College of Education. In 2021-2022 the SPPC
will include Drs. Ryan Farmer (Director of the MA/EdS Program), Beth
Meisinger (Director of the PhD Program), Randy Floyd (Psychology
Department Chair), Ryan Farmer (Clinical Assistant Professor and
Director of the Psychological Services Center), Emily Srisarajivakul
(Assistant Professor), and (Dr. Steve Zanskas, Dean’s Faculty Fellow for
the College of Education. Student members as needed will be asked to
participate on the SPPC.</p>
<p>Like the former SPCC’s authority over the MA/EdS degree program, the
SPPC has policy authority over the MA/EdS and the MS/PhD degree
programs. The committee ensures that its policies are consistent with
the policies of the Department of Psychology while maintaining the
necessary adaptations enacted in the past for the EdS degree governed by
the College of Education (e.g., 30 semester hours beyond the MA degree
including the internship and requirements of the overall sequence as
approved by the SPPC).</p>
<p>The following policies apply to the committee:</p>
<div id="establishment-of-the-sppc" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Establishment of the SPPC<a href="the-school-psychology-program-committee-sppc.html#establishment-of-the-sppc" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The SPPC shall consist of the following persons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The core faculty of the school psychology program from the
Department of Psychology, to include faculty whose primary
assignment is to the MA/EdS and the PhD programs; in effect, all
members of the school psychology core faculty. </li>
<li>A representative from the College of Education’s administration
selected by the Dean of the COE and approved by the core school
psychology faculty.  This is usually a dean’s office level
person with broad understanding of the COE.  At the discretion
of the Dean, this person may be drawn from the areas of special
education, educational psychology, or counseling.</li>
<li>Students (e.g., from the MA/EdS level and the PhD levels of the
program) may be asked to participate in the SPPC governance. The
students will serve as ad hoc members, called upon as needed by
the SPPC. </li>
<li>Faculty member vacancies are replaced in a timely fashion
through the same process as the original selection procedure
(see A-1-a &amp; b, and A-2). </li>
<li>One or more practicing school psychologists may be asked to
participate in the SPPC governance. These professionals will
serve as ad hoc members, called upon as needed by the SPPC.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The SPPC requires a continuity of membership from year to year.
Faculty selected to serve on the SPPC shall be expected to serve
throughout their terms of appointment by the Department of
Psychology or the College of Education. A core school psychology
faculty member may choose not to serve for reasons acceptable to the
SPPC and at the discretion of the SPPC a faculty member from another
area of the Department of Psychology or the College of Education may
be chosen to serve in that person’s stead.</p></li>
<li><p>The SPPC Chair shall rotate annually between the MA/EdS and PhD
program directors, beginning with the MA/EdS director in 2015. A
history of the SPPC chair is presented below with the year
representing the fall in which the chair began.</p>

the meeting shall determine the decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Each faculty member of the SPPC has equal voting power (1 vote).</p></li>
<li><p>Student ad hoc members shall neither be present nor vote on
deliberations related to fellow students currently enrolled in the
program (e.g., examination results, appeals, retention decisions).</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimate responsibility for the operation of the program rests with
the Chair of the Department of Psychology and policy decisions
regarding the program are subject to such review.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subcommittees</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Subcommittee on Admissions shall be established each year as per
the policy on admissions.</p></li>
<li><p>If needed, a Subcommittee on Examinations shall be established as
per the policy on examinations.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional subcommittees shall be established as judged appropriate
by the SPPC.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to these policies</strong></p>
<p>This governance document is reviewed annually to ensure that new
policies and amendments to the document have been included. These
policies may be temporarily suspended by the proper motion, second, and
affirmative vote of two-thirds of a quorum present at a SPPC meeting; or
the policies may be permanently changed by the proper motion, second,
and affirmative vote of two-thirds of the SPPC’s eligible voting
members.</p>
