## Research Requirements and Expectations

### Expectations of All Students  
All students are expected to be involved in research. While students in the PhD program engage in intensive research training, MA/EdS students are also encouraged to participate through various means, including:

- Attending meetings of the Child and Family Studies Research Group  
- Voluntary involvement in research labs  
- Research responsibilities through assistantship assignments

### Child and Family Studies Research Group  
All school psychology students are affiliated with the Child and Family Studies Research Group, which meets during the fall and spring semesters. MA/EdS students are **strongly encouraged**, but not required, to attend these meetings.

If needed to meet full-time status requirements, students may enroll in:  
**PSYC 7619: Research Practicum â€“ Child and Family Studies**  
Note: Credit hours earned in this course do **not** count toward degree requirements.

### Voluntary Participation  
MA/EdS students frequently volunteer to work on research projects led by faculty or fellow students. These projects may take place on campus, in local schools, or within community agencies. Students considering doctoral study are especially encouraged to gain voluntary research experience.

### Research and Teaching Assistantships  
Some MA/EdS students are offered graduate assistantships involving research and/or teaching. Assistantship appointments typically range from **10 to 20 hours per week**. Compensation and tuition waiver eligibility vary by assignment and funding availability.

### Thesis and Dissertation  
Only doctoral program students are required to complete a research thesis (MS) and a dissertation (PhD).  

- MA/EdS students are **not required** to complete a thesis.  
- Students who previously completed a thesis at another institution must have it reviewed for departmental acceptance.  
- MA/EdS students who may transition to a doctoral program are **encouraged** to complete a thesis during their time in the program.

Detailed requirements for theses and dissertations are outlined in the [Graduate Program Handbook](#) (link to be added).
