<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.1</span> Policy For Admission to The MA/EdS Program In School Psychology<a href="policies.html#admissionspolicy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>(Revised 8/3/99, Reapproved, June, 2007, Revised July, 2008; updated July 2009, July 2013, June 2015, July 2022)</em></p>
<p>The Admissions Subcommittee:<br />
The subcommittee is responsible for evaluating applicants to both the MA and EdS degrees, subject to policies and procedures established by the School Psychology Program Committee. Membership on the subcommittee includes at least three members of the core faculty of the program and the COE representative. The MA/EdS Director (or other designee) serves as the subcommittee chair and oversees the receipt of applications and filing of decisions of the subcommittee. Each subcommittee member reviews and evaluates every applicant; application reviews may be conducted by email with applicant descriptions circulated to the subcommittee by the program director.</p>
<p>Admission Standards:<br />
A. The admissions criteria for both the MA and EdS degrees include:<br />
- Undergraduate overall GPA of 3.00 (consideration will be given to applicants with GPA in range of 2.50-2.99).<br />
- GRE scores will no longer be required.<br />
- Three letters of recommendation from persons familiar with the applicant’s work.<br />
- The applicant must have completed at least 18 semester hours in psychology and/or education courses.<br />
- Completion of appropriate application forms.<br />
- Submission of undergraduate and/or graduate transcripts</p>
<p>B. Students must complete the entire MA/EdS sequence or its equivalent for TDOE licensure endorsement.</p>
<p>C. Admission to the EdS degree level is contingent upon successful completion of all MA requirements in school psychology (or their equivalent), successful completion of any oral and/or written comprehensive examinations at the end of the MA sequence, and completion of appropriate form(s) for the program and Graduate School (these include the EdS Program of Studies and Candidacy Form and the Graduate School’s Change of Status form). A student holding a master’s degree from another university and desiring entrance to the EdS level must satisfy the above requirements for entrance to the EdS.</p>
<p>Deadlines:<br />
Students are admitted only into the fall semester. The admissions deadline is established by the MA/EdS Director. There are two deadlines for admission: Early Consideration is March 5th and Regular Consideration is May 1st. Applications will be reviewed in the 2-3 weeks following the deadline and students will be notified of their acceptance within 2-3 weeks following review of applications. Students admitted for fall may enter in the summer semester (SPPC Minutes, 3/5/98). It is the student’s responsibility to assure that all materials related to admission have been filed.</p>
<p>Diversity:<br />
The program is sensitive to the need for greater cultural and ethnic diversity in the statewide and nationwide delivery of school psychological services and is committed to actively recruiting a diverse student population to assist in meeting this need. In accordance with overall University policy, the admissions process does not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or lifestyle choice.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.2</span> Policy Regarding Responsibility for Student Advising in the MA/EdS Program in School Psychology<a href="policies.html#studentadvisingpolicy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>(Effective 1998-1999; updated May 2002, July 2013, June 2014, June 2015, July 2021)</em></p>
<p>School psychology program advising is primarily about academic requirements for degree completion. However, students are also expected to seek advising on related matters such as employment and credentialing, advanced graduate studies, personal development, and program evaluation. Advising sessions should be held with the student’s advisor at least once per semester. Advising is provided throughout the period from application to completion of all degree requirements. The student’s advisor maintains a file on each advisee which is updated as part of the periodic student advising process. The program faculty members are also available to assist students throughout the period of internship and as needed during the early years of their career.</p>
<p>Each student has a primary advisor with whom he/she works. Only in the absence of the primary advisor should students seek the advisement of other program faculty. Students enrolled in the Master of Arts (MA) program are advised by the program MA/EdS director or by the director’s designee from among the core school psychology faculty. Currently, MA students have as their primary advisor Dr. Ryan Farmer with the assistance of Drs. Randy Floyd or Beth Meisinger.</p>
<p>Students in the Educational Specialist degree (EdS) program have as their primary advisor, Dr. Ryan Farmer, Director of the MA/EdS Program who collaborates with the designated person in the College of Education (COE, currently, Dr. Steve Zanskas, Dean’s Faculty Fellow for the college), for the advising of students in the EdS degree sequence. The COE person assists the student in completing application and degree completion materials. The MA/EdS program director advises the student on course requirements and assists in completing the student’s degree plan. The degree plan is approved by the director and COE person, both of whom also serve as the student’s committee.</p>
<p>The MA/EdS director maintains a file on each student enrolled in the program which is updated as part of the periodic student evaluation process. A permanent file of graduates is also maintained by the Psychology Department. Non-degree, licensure endorsement students are advised by the MA/EdS program director who files a proposed endorsement program with the Teacher Licensure Office (COE) for initial approval and an endorsement recommendation after the student has completed all requirements. As faculty members of the Department of Psychology, the director and core program faculty may have advisory responsibilities for undergraduate psychology majors. The Director of the MA/EdS Program also confers with prospective students seeking a career in school psychology.</p>

<div id="residencypolicy" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="16.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.3</span> Policy Regarding Residency in the MA/EdS Program In School Psychology<a href="policies.html#residencypolicy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Regular and intensive pursuit of the School Psychology Program are expected of all students. Though no formal non-doctoral residency requirements exist at The University of Memphis, the MA/EdS program requires the student to pursue studies in consecutive semesters until finished, and to enroll in a minimum of nine (9-12) semester hours each semester; students often complete 3 to 6 hours across the summer sessions. The nine hours may include enrollment for credit in the Child, Adolescent, and Family Studies meetings and/or the Professional Experience; however, these credits are not counted as part of the overall MA/EdS program). Exceptions to the policy are made in instances where the student’s remaining courses and experiences do not require nine hours of enrollment, or by special circumstances receiving the approval of the MA/EdS Director. (See Minutes of SPCC, March 5, 1998)</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of traditional and emerging instructional methodologies for the completion of curriculum requirements, the program will allow up to 4 courses (typically 12 sem. hrs.) of on-line learning to be applied to the entire 60-66 hr. MA/EdS requirement. The online course(s) must receive prior approval of the MA/EdS Director for students enrolled in the program, or approval at the time of program entrance for online courses already completed. Online courses will not be approved for core courses (PSYC 7/8800 courses) and field experiences including practica and internship. This policy will be reviewed periodically as a means of keeping up to date with online offerings and the need for flexibility in training practices.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.4</span> Policy for the Periodic Evaluation of Students in the School Psychology Program<a href="policies.html#periodicevaluationpolicy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The periodic evaluation of students is important to judging their progress and that of the program. Periodic evaluation sessions identify student strengths and weaknesses as they relate to their success as school psychologists. The evaluations also provide the opportunity to establish short- and long-range goals for continued professional development and to acquire specific career information. In addition, periodic evaluations provide the opportunity to establish short- and long-range goals for program development and delivery. Thus, periodic evaluation is a two-way process providing information related to both student and program development. The following shall guide the periodic evaluation process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic evaluation sessions are held with each student individually at least once per year during his/her enrollment in the program.<br />
</li>
<li>Sessions are scheduled by the MA/EdS Director and include as many as possible of the other program faculty and the College of Education representative.<br />
</li>
<li>First and second year students are formally evaluated following the spring semester, usually at meetings scheduled in May or June.<br />
</li>
<li>The session should review, but not be limited to the following:
<ul>
<li>the student’s academic progress in courses including grades, specific skills (e.g., report writing, case management), and conceptual development;<br />
</li>
<li>the advisor’s judgment of the student’s personal-social behavior as related to the practice of school psychology;<br />
</li>
<li>the student’s perception of his/her academic and personal progress and overall suitability to the field of school psychology;<br />
</li>
<li>the student’s perception of the overall quality of program instruction, supervision, and administration;<br />
</li>
<li>an overall summary of the student’s progress toward degree completion, a recommendation for internship, and eventual endorsement for licensure.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The general format of the review is guided by the Student Evaluation and Performance Portfolio Summary (SEPPS) (see p. 39-40; Appendix A) which reviews progress in all areas related to the program’s goals that are derived from NASP’s training competency areas. The SEPPS is included with the student’s portfolio at the time of the session that is subsequently rated by the faculty. The SEPPS Form and Guidelines for its Completion are made available to students in advance of each annual review.<br />
</li>
<li>Following the session, student progress is rated by the faculty and a summary sheet prepared and provided to the student. A copy of the summary is maintained by the MA/EdS Director.<br />
</li>
<li>At meetings of the School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC), the Director of the MA/EdS Program shall report on the overall status of the students based on their periodic evaluations. The SPPC may choose to meet with a student to clarify evaluation information or to conduct an appeal of the student’s evaluation.<br />
</li>
<li>Students whose progress in one or more areas is judged to be unsatisfactory by both the primary advisor and the MA/EdS Director may appeal the judgment to the SPPC. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the student to make a written request to the Director of the MA/EdS Program for an appeal including a brief justification for the appeal. The request must be submitted within two weeks of the student’s receipt of the Director of the MA/EdS Program’s evaluation summary. In turn, the Director of the MA/EdS Program will schedule an appeal meeting with the SPPC or subcommittee thereof, at which the student must appear. The SPPC may choose to affirm the judgment of the Director of the MA/EdS Program, reverse the judgment of the Director of the MA/EdS Program, or table the matter for further investigation and consideration. In so doing, the SPPC may choose to add or delete specific recommendations/objectives established during the previous evaluation sessions with the primary advisor and the Director of the MA/EdS Program.<br />
</li>
<li>Additional sessions are generally conducted in conjunction with the student’s regular academic advising for registration each semester. It is the responsibility of the student to schedule an advising session each semester with the primary advisor.<br />
</li>
<li>Interns are evaluated through separate procedures at mid-year and at the end of the internship.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.5</span> Policy for Receiving a Recommendation to and Completing the EdS Level Internship in School Psychology<a href="policies.html#internshippolicy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>(Revised July, 2008; Updated, 2012, 2013, 2015)</em></p>
<p>The school psychology internship is the culminating experience for the EdS degree. Appearing at or near the end of the training program, the internship is entered only by students who are adequately prepared to meet its demands. Students may neither seek nor enter an internship without the approval of the Director of the MA/EdS Program. If a student enters an internship without the Director of the MA/EdS Program’s approval, the program will not participate in the intern’s supervision, nor will the experience be considered as fulfilling the internship requirement for degree completion or licensure endorsement.</p>
<p>A recommendation to enter an internship is made by the MA/EdS Director. The student must meet all the following requirements:<br />
- The student is in good academic standing, maintaining a minimum 3.00 GPA for all graduate level work applicable to the school psychology MA/EdS sequence at the time of entering the internship.<br />
- The student has received a grade of “B” or better in all assessment classes as prerequisite to entering any practica. The student must have received a satisfactory grade (S) in all practica. The practica must be completed prior to entering the internship.<br />
- Except in cases of externship (where the internship is spread over two academic years), the student should have completed all other program requirements prior to entering the internship. With approval of the Director of the MA/EdS Program, a student may complete no more than two courses during the internship period. Students may not enter the internship if more than two courses remain to be taken in addition to the internship.<br />
- The student has been judged to be making satisfactory progress in all areas during the most recent periodic evaluation review.<br />
- The student, with the assistance of the MA/EdS Director, has located an internship site and a plan of internship has been prepared which conforms to NASP standards. The Director of the MA/EdS Program’s approval of the plan represents formal approval for the student to enter the internship.<br />
- The intern is not employed full-time in any other capacity with the host internship agency or school district.</p>
<p>Students should initiate their search for an internship at least six months in advance of its starting date. The MA/EdS Director grants approval to seek an internship only when the following requirements have been met:<br />
- The student is in good academic standing, maintaining a minimum 3.00 GPA for all graduate level work applicable to the school psychology MA/EdS sequence.<br />
- The student has completed at least 48 of the 54 pre-internship hours required in the program.<br />
- <strong>NOTE:</strong> Students on assistantship, who are required to maintain enrollment for 9 sem. hrs. each semester, and whose tuition is waived, may enroll for internship in advance of starting the internship when their schedules can accommodate this. The “in progress” (IP) grade is maintained until the internship is completed in the regular manner. Permission of the MA/EdS Director is required.<br />
- The student has been judged to be making satisfactory progress in all areas during the most recent periodic evaluation review.</p>
<p>Recommendation letters from the Director of the MA/EdS Program and other faculty are expected to be a part of the student’s application for an internship. The Director of the MA/EdS Program’s letter of recommendation is required and represents the Director of the MA/EdS Program’s approval to seek an internship.</p>
<p>Internship experiences are designed to be in accord with the training and field placement standards of the National Association of School Psychologists. The experience is a minimum of 1200 clock hours, at least half of which is completed in a school setting. The internship, and the intern’s expected period of service, extends across the entire school year. The experience is not considered to have been completed simply on the basis of 1200 hours of satisfactory service. The internship is completed only when the agency/district-based supervisor provides a final evaluation of satisfactory completion to the MA/EdS Director. On the basis of the supervisor’s letter, the results of on-campus and on-site meetings, and any other evaluation information, the Director of the MA/EdS Program records a final grade for the student (Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory). The student must receive a satisfactory (S) grade for the internship in order to complete the program requirements and receive licensure endorsement.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.6</span> Policy for the MA and EdS Specialty Examinations<a href="policies.html#specialtyexampolicy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>(Revised 2006, Updated 2007, Revised July 2013, Update June 2015)</em></p>
<p>It is the philosophy of the School Psychology Program to prepare individuals who fulfill the Tennessee Department of Education requirements for licensure as a school psychologist, and who will perform competently on the job. The specialty examination is one means of quality control related to this objective. The specialty examination assists both faculty and students in determining apparent strengths and weaknesses related to program goals. Though a student may be terminated for poor performance on the examination, in general it is the purpose of the examination to provide a means toward improving the student’s overall competence.</p>
<p>The specialty examination attempts to evaluate the student’s understanding of his/her studies and skills related to the practice of school psychology. At the MA level, students must complete a written examination if continuing into the EdS level or if terminating at the MA level. All EdS level students complete a written comprehensive examination, typically the ETS Praxis Exam in School Psychology.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.6.1</span> Guidelines for the MA Examination<a href="policies.html#guidelines-for-the-ma-examination" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The exam is conducted with each student individually in the semester during which the student plans to complete the MA degree.<br />
</li>
<li>The student must be in good academic standing and judged to have made satisfactory academic and personal progress in the program.<br />
</li>
<li>The exam is related to the legal and ethical aspects of school psychology and students are typically provided one or more situations to which they must respond. The exam and the student response may be conveyed by email. Responses are evaluated as “Pass-Fail” by the person administering the exam, which is usually the MA/EdS Director.<br />
</li>
<li>Following the examination, the student’s performance is reported to the student and the MA/EdS Director conveys the results on the appropriate examination form to the Graduate School.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.6.2</span> Guidelines for the EdS Examination<a href="policies.html#guidelines-for-the-eds-examination" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Beginning in 2006, the ETS Praxis Exam in School Psychology was substituted for the traditional written comprehensive examination. The examination requirement consists of both written and oral components. The written component is the ETS Praxis Exam in School Psychology. The oral component is integrated with the February intern visit to campus during which we discuss your evaluation of the program and our evaluation of your internship. In order to complete the EdS examination requirement, each student must submit an acceptable score for school psychology credentialing by the Tennessee Department of Education (currently 147 since 2014). The student will not be approved to receive the EdS degree without an acceptable score on the Praxis examination in school psychology.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">16.6.2.1</span> Procedure<a href="policies.html#procedure" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Each student must submit to the MA/EdS Director an official written documentation of his or her acceptable Praxis score no later than one week before the Graduate School deadline for submitting comprehensive examination scores for graduation in that semester. Because the ETS refuses to send official scores to individuals (e.g., the MA/EdS Director), the student is permitted to provide a photocopy of his/her official personal results notice.<br />
</li>
<li>The student may take the Praxis exam more than once according to the schedule set by ETS. It is recommended that students take the exam late in the first semester or early in the second semester of the internship.<br />
</li>
<li>If the student’s score is not acceptable by the deadline for that semester, the student will be required to repeat the Praxis examination and submit an acceptable score in time for graduation and at the end of the next semester.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">16.6.2.2</span> Exception<a href="policies.html#exception" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>For students who for whatever reason are not completing the internship but seeking to complete the EdS by substitute course work (which is very rare), they would be required to take a traditional written examination at a scheduled time during the semester in which he or she plans to graduate.<br />
- The student must be in good academic standing and judged to have made satisfactory academic and personal progress in the program, including the internship.<br />
- The exam covers the content of the MA/EdS degree sequences, and may consider the student’s academic and personal progress, the student’s assessment of career goals, and the student’s evaluation of the program.<br />
- The examination consists of at least six essay items, developed by a subcommittee of at least two program faculty.<br />
- Following the examination, each subcommittee member reads the entire exam, votes on the student’s performance on each item, and makes an overall rating of the student’s performance on the exam.<br />
- The ratings are gathered and recorded by the MA/EdS Director. In cases where the ratings are considerably discrepant, the Director of the MA/EdS Program will establish a meeting of the examination committee to determine an overall rating on the exam; this meeting may include a discussion with the student. Following the meeting, the committee will decide (by majority vote) if the student has passed the examination. Where ratings are in close agreement, the Director of the MA/EdS Program conveys to the student the overall rating (Pass/Fail) on the exam.</p>
<p>Students failing either the MA or the EdS traditional written examination may apply to take the examination a second and final time in the semester following the first administration. Failure on the second administration will result in dismissal from the program.</p>

<p>Degree: The Educational Specialist or higher degree (or its equivalent) including preparation specifically in school psychology. A recommendation is made only when the applicant has completed all requirements of The University of Memphis MA/EdS program or the equivalent. A person seeking licensure endorsement who has prior degrees and/or licensure from outside Tennessee will have requirements determined individually to be equivalent to the training level of the licensure requirements specified below.

<p><em>(Effective 1998-1999, Update July, 2013)</em></p>
<p>Occasionally persons seek the assistance of the program in achieving licensure after moving to Tennessee from out of state where they were trained and/or practiced as school psychologists, or after completing degrees in fields other than school psychology. Persons already holding a credential as a school psychologist in another state are directed to seek licensure reciprocity directly through the licensure office in the TDOE. As a TDOE approved program, the University of Memphis School Psychology Program endorses for TDOE licensure only persons who have completed the MA/EdS approved program or its equivalent. The following policies shall be applied to this process:<br />
- The Director of the MA/EdS Program holds a preliminary meeting with the person to make a judgment of the person’s admissibility to the program and to review previous work. The Director of the MA/EdS Program advises the person as to what will be required for admission to the program as a degree or non-degree student, and also provides a judgment regarding additional work required for endorsement. If the person concurs and chooses to go forward with the process, he/she then submits an application to enter the program as a degree or non-degree student.<br />
- The applicant’s previous work shall be reviewed by the MA/EdS Director to determine what additional courses and experiences are required to reach program equivalency. In some instance, this will require enough additional work that the applicant will be asked to enroll in the MA and/or EdS degree programs. In other instances where only a few additional requirements remain, the applicant may choose to be admitted as a non-degree student.<br />
- A time limit for previous work is not imposed. However, the burden rests with the applicant to demonstrate that his/her knowledge and skills are commensurate with the expectations for current students. In the absence of such demonstration, required courses and experiences must be repeated. Competency may be achieved through repeating courses or experiences, obtaining credit by examination, validation of previous courses, presenting letters attesting to one’s skills, or actual demonstration of skills through practicum.<br />
- In the process of achieving program equivalency, the person must make regular application to the program and be admitted according to the guidelines for degree seeking program students.<br />
- In addition to the usual application materials (university and departmental application forms, GRE scores, all undergraduate and graduate transcripts), the person must submit letters from previous faculty, employers, or others familiar with his/her work.<br />
- The application must include information regarding relevant education and psychology credentials already held.<br />
- The application is reviewed through the regular admission subcommittee process. If admitted to the program, the student’s degree/non-degree requirements for endorsement are reviewed again by the COE program co-director.<br />
- Once admitted, the student must pursue required courses and experiences according to the residency policy. The student’s work is reviewed each semester as per the policy for periodic review.<br />
- If the student is completing the MA and/or the EdS degree, he or she must complete the required annual review sessions and pass the corresponding written examination requirements.<br />
- Once the student’s requirements are completed, the student will file for endorsement through the Office of Teacher Education &amp; Student Support Services of the CO and the MA/EdS Director will file the final review form, as is customary for other students.<br />
- <strong>Note:</strong> Students with prior work almost always complete the EdS degree enroute to endorsement. Thus, although the program provides for the endorsement training of students already holding an EdS or greater degree or its equivalent, it is a very rare occasion.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.9</span> Responsibilities of the Director of the MA/EdS School Psychology Program<a href="policies.html#directorpolicy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>(Effective 1998-1999, Updated July 2013, June 2015)</em></p>
<p>The day-to-day operation of the School Psychology Program is administered from the Department of Psychology. The director of the MA/EdS School Psychology Program is an academic appointment in the Department of Psychology, and the position is filled according to the policies and procedures of the Department of Psychology. Matters of retention, tenure and promotion are also determined by the Department of Psychology. The MA/EdS director serves as the principal representative of that program to the School Psychology Program Committee (SPPC). All matters related to the development, maintenance, and operation of the program are determined by the SPPC and directed to the MA/EdS director for appropriate action. The director represents the MA/EdS program to several constituencies including the Department of Psychology, the COE, the general university community, the Tennessee Department of Education, accreditors, other university programs, practicum and internship sites, community agencies, and the general public.</p>
<p>The director serves as a member of the SPPC. In this capacity, the director brings important matters before the SPPC. As the official policy making body of the program, the SPPC resolves business and establishes policies that are then put into effect by the MA/EdS director. Responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the program is delegated to the MA/EdS director by the SPPC. Specific functions related to day-to-day operation include:<br />
- Recruitment of students. This may include developing program descriptions and brochures for dissemination, visitations to other colleges and universities, career advising of potential students.<br />
- With assistance of the Admission’s Secretary in the Department of Psychology, the director screens all incoming applications, removing those that do not meet minimal expectations for further review by the admissions subcommittee. Those worthy of review are forwarded by the director to the subcommittee for review, and the subcommittee’s decisions are processed by the Admissions Secretary to the Graduate Office.<br />
- Reviewing program policies, curricular requirements and electives, and making recommendations for improvement to the SPPC.<br />
- Assists in advising students currently enrolled in the program as per the policy on advising.<br />

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.10</span> Policy on Student Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools<a href="policies.html#aipolicy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>(Effective July 2025)</em></p>
<div id="purpose-and-scope" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="16.10.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.10.1</span> Purpose and Scope<a href="policies.html#purpose-and-scope" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This policy outlines expectations for the ethical, appropriate, and legally compliant use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools by students in the MA/EdS program. These expectations apply across all domains of training, including academic work, clinical practice, and research. While the program recognizes the educational potential of AI tools—particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini—student use must reflect the professional values of school psychology and comply with ethical and legal standards, particularly those related to client confidentiality and academic integrity.</p>
<p>Students are responsible for the content of all academic, clinical, and research work they submit, regardless of whether AI tools were used. Any work supported by AI must be critically reviewed, edited, and appropriately attributed. AI tools must not replace the student’s own academic writing, clinical reasoning, or research decision-making. Students are encouraged to consult with faculty or supervisors before using AI tools in any new or uncertain context. Students should recognize that AI tools can generate inaccurate, outdated, or biased content and must critically evaluate all AI-supported output.</p>
<p>Students are also encouraged to consider the level of risk associated with AI use. For example, high-risk uses involve personal or client information and are strictly prohibited; low-risk uses (like grammar checks on non-clinical documents) are permitted with disclosure. Faculty are encouraged to model ethical AI use in their instruction and provide explicit guidance in their syllabi regarding appropriate and inappropriate use.</p>
<p>The program also recognizes that AI tools may serve as assistive technology for students with documented disabilities. In such cases, students may request approval to use AI tools as a support, provided the use aligns with accessibility goals and institutional policies.</p>
</div>
<div id="confidentiality-and-client-information" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="16.10.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.10.2</span> Confidentiality and Client Information<a href="policies.html#confidentiality-and-client-information" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Under no circumstances should students enter information about real clients into AI tools that are not institutionally approved. This includes both identified and de-identified clinical material. Most publicly available AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) are not HIPAA- or FERPA-compliant, and their use to process clinical information constitutes a serious breach of ethical and legal standards. Students may not use AI tools to draft psychological reports, treatment plans, clinical notes, or emails involving client material.</p>
</div>
<div id="academic-use" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="16.10.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.10.3</span> Academic Use<a href="policies.html#academic-use" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>AI tools may be used in coursework with instructor permission and within the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permitted uses</strong> include outlining, grammar checking, brainstorming, tabulation of information, reviewing APA formatting, or for assessing or improving tone.<br />
</li>
<li>Students should <strong>not</strong> submit AI-generated content as their own. This prohibition includes using AI tools to generate citations and references.<br />
</li>
<li>When AI tools are used to assist with academic work submitted to a course instructor as an assignment or in meeting a program milestone, students must include a brief note of disclosure indicating when and how the tools were used. For example:<br />
&gt; “Portions of this paper were assisted using ChatGPT on July 7, 2025 for outlining and grammar checking. All written content reflects the student’s own original work.”<br />
</li>
<li>Other use of AI tools for any assignments or exams is not permitted unless explicitly approved by the instructor.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.10.4</span> Clinical Use<a href="policies.html#clinical-use" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Given the ethical and legal responsibilities associated with practicum and internship placements, students may <strong>not</strong> use AI tools to support clinical casework. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students should <strong>not</strong> input clinical, client-related, or school-based case material into AI tools.<br />
</li>
<li>AI tools may <strong>not</strong> be used to write, revise, or summarize psychological reports or clinical notes.<br />
</li>
<li>AI tools may <strong>not</strong> be used to simulate counseling, create behavior management plans, or generate diagnostic impressions, even hypothetically, unless part of a structured educational activity involving no real client data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may use AI tools to explore academic content related to school psychology (e.g., reviewing intervention strategies or theoretical frameworks), provided that no client information is included. Students may also use AI to help them improve templates or to generate suggestions related to a general referral concern (e.g., identifying evidence-based reading fluency interventions), but they must not include specific case details.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-use" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="16.10.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.10.5</span> Research Use<a href="policies.html#research-use" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Students may use AI tools in research for specific, transparent purposes with research advisor approval.</p>
<ul>
<li>Appropriate uses include summarizing existing literature, checking grammar, outlining ideas, tabulating results, or assisting with coding tasks in concert with human review. This is not a complete list due to the evolving nature of AI. Consult with your research advisor and/or committee when unsure.<br />
</li>
<li>Students should <strong>not</strong> replace their own critical thinking processes, including integrating content, with AI.<br />
</li>
<li>AI tools must <strong>not</strong> be used to fabricate, manipulate, or analyze data.<br />
</li>
<li>Any use of AI in theses, papers, presentations, or other work products must be disclosed.<br />
</li>
<li>Students may <strong>not</strong> enter identifiable or sensitive data into AI systems. See the sections on (a) Confidentiality and Client Information and (b) Clinical Use.</li>

The department encourages students to follow the steps below, which are consistent with the Psychology Department <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/psychology/graduate/psych-grad-handbook-10-2019.pdf">Graduate Student Handbook</a>, p. 32.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Informal Resolution</strong> – Whenever possible, students should first address concerns directly with the faculty member, supervisor, or other person involved. Students may also consult informally with their Program Director, the Graduate Coordinator, the Department Chair, or Psychology Student Government Association (PSGA) officers. Conversations at this stage, except in harassment/discrimination cases, can generally remain confidential. Details for reporting complaints or concerns are available at this website: <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/psychology/graduate/gscc_complaints.php">https://www.memphis.edu/psychology/graduate/gscc_complaints.php</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Written Grievance</strong> – If the concern cannot be resolved informally, the student may submit a written grievance to their Program Director describing the issue, relevant facts, and desired resolution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Program Review</strong> – The Program Director will review the grievance and may meet with relevant parties to seek resolution. If further review is needed, the Director may recommend formation of a departmental grievance committee, in accordance with Appendix A of the Graduate Student Handbook.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Departmental Review</strong> – The grievance committee (if formed) will review the matter and make a recommendation to the Department Chair. The Chair will communicate the decision to the student.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>University Procedures</strong> – If the student is not satisfied with the departmental outcome, they may pursue further appeal through the University’s formal grievance channels as outlined in the Graduate Catalog. Separate University procedures apply to grade disputes and to harassment/discrimination complaints, as described in the Handbook.</p></li>
