# Program Philosophy {#philosophy}

A societal emphasis has been placed on schools to provide a better future for children through a life-long educative process. In their professional roles, school psychologists are sensitive to the needs of a culturally diverse community, value the importance of children to the future of society, and advocate on behalf of children. As an integral part of human services available to children, adolescents, adults, and families, school psychologists’ function across multiple settings with a focus on educational institutions. School psychologists address diverse referral issues with varied services such as psychoeducational assessment, consultation, counseling and other interventions, in-service education, administrative services, research and evaluation.

The primary distinction that separates school psychology from other psychological specialties is the combining of education and psychology in the study and delivery of services to children, youth, families, and learners of all ages. The additional focus of education to this area of psychology stems from the assumption that schools play a primary nurturing and socializing role in the lives of all individuals. School psychologists focus on the natural ecologies of children, youth, families, learners, and persons involved in schooling, and the process of schooling in multiple settings. Because of their training in both education and psychology, school psychologists are in a unique position to coordinate educational, psychological, and behavioral health services to learners across the life span. The curriculum of our program is an integrated course of study in areas of education and psychology that contribute to the preparation of school psychologists, in addition to a core of school psychology courses.

The overall philosophy of the school psychology program at The University of Memphis is an ecological, empirically based model that focuses on the multiple systems in which children exist. This perspective recognizes the complex interaction of person variables within and across multiple systems. This philosophy also acknowledges that the way problems are defined influences the subsequent use of assessment and intervention strategies. Using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model (panel A) and Bandura’s notion of reciprocal determinism (panel B), this blend of problem definition and system analysis is driven by the following premises.

-   The client is not only the center of the ecological model but is also an active participant who brings multiple dynamics to the model.
-   The context in which the client resides includes multiple systems that have both direct and indirect influences. The microsystem includes immediate environments such as home, school, and community. Larger systems such as the cultural and political context of the community (e.g., exosystem and macrosystem) influence the client’s microsystem indirectly. The mesosytem includes interactions between the client and his/her microsystem and the larger systems.
-   A reciprocal relationship exists between client and system. The client acts on his/her environment exerting control and influence over variables in the immediate and larger systems. Also, the multiple contexts in which the client resides influence the psycho-social development, adjustment and educational experiences and performance of the client.
-   School psychologists intervene in the ecology in multiple ways. For existing concerns, problems are defined with information related to the client, the multiple contexts, and the interaction between the client and context. This information guides the practice of school psychology including prevention, assessment, and intervention services.
-   Additionally, school psychologists provide services that assist in the creation of healthy individuals and systems. These services focus on wellness and maintenance of healthy environments and individuals.

The overarching program model reflects the scientist-practitioner approach that balances knowledge, competencies, and skills in both research and practice. Students draw upon scientific literature to make decisions regarding practice with a focus on selecting and using empirically supported services while avoiding untested, ineffective, unnecessary, or harmful practices. Students are also instructed regarding basic program evaluation techniques and treatment monitoring and evaluation to determine the effectiveness of their assessment and interventions. In addition to these skill areas, doctoral students are trained in more advanced design and statistical techniques to become producers of scientific knowledge for the practice of school psychology. All students are taught to use a scientific, problem focused model to make clinical decisions by operationalizing problems, identifying appropriate data collection techniques, analyzing, and interpreting data collected, and utilized the findings to determine the target variables for intervention.

The MA/EdS program focuses on practitioner training for the delivery of comprehensive school psychological services primarily in school settings. The training of practitioner skills follows a curricular sequence in assessment and intervention with a focus on linking problem-solving assessment and intervention to all roles of the school psychologist. In this manner the curriculum is constructed along the lines of NASP’s Model for Comprehensive and Integrated School Psychological Services, and its related standards for program approval. In addition to practitioner skills, MA/EdS students are trained in a “scientist as consumer” model which emphasizes the use of research findings and evidenced-based practices in clinical decision-making.

**Program Goals and Content Domains\
**The overall goal of the MA/EdS program is that students will successfully complete the domain-related requirements of the program, obtain credentialing for school-based practice from the Tennessee Department of Education or comparable authority in other states, and seek National Certification in School Psychology (NCSP). The MA/EdS curriculum and student evaluations are organized to be consistent with the following NASP domains, See the domain-course crosswalk in Chapter \@ref(curriculum).

# 2020 Domains of School Psychology Training & Practice {#domains}

**Domain 1: Data-Based Decision Making**:\
School psychologists understand and utilize assessment methods for identifying strengths and needs; developing effective interventions, services, and programs; and measuring progress and outcomes within a multitiered system of support. School psychologists use a problem-solving framework as the basis for all professional activities. School psychologists systematically collect data from multiple sources as a foundation for decision-making at the individual, group, and systems levels, and they consider ecological factors (e.g., classroom, family, and community characteristics) as a context for assessment and intervention.

**Domain 2: Consultation and Collaboration:**\
School psychologists understand varied models and strategies of consultation and collaboration applicable to individuals, families, groups, and systems, as well as methods to promote effective implementation of services. As part of a systematic and comprehensive process of effective decision making and problem solving that permeates all aspects of service delivery, school psychologists demonstrate skills to consult, collaborate, and communicate effectively with others.

**Domain 3: Academic Interventions and Instructional Supports:**\
School psychologists understand the biological, cultural, and social influences on academic skills; human learning, cognitive, and developmental processes; and evidence-based curricula and instructional strategies. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, use assessment and data collection methods to implement and evaluate services that support academic skill development in children.

**Domain 4: Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions:**\
School psychologists understand the biological, cultural, developmental, and social influences on mental and behavioral health, behavioral and emotional impacts on learning, and evidence-based strategies to promote social–emotional functioning. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, design, implement, and evaluate services that promote resilience and positive behavior, support socialization and adaptive skills, and enhance mental and behavioral health.

**Domain 5: School-Wide Practices to Promote Learning:**\
School psychologists understand systems structures, organization, and theory; general and special education programming; implementation science; and evidence-based, school-wide practices that promote learning, positive behavior, and mental health. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, develop and implement practices and strategies to create and maintain safe, effective, and supportive learning environments for students and school staff.

**Domain 6: Services to Promote Safe and Supportive Schools:**\
School psychologists understand principles and research related to social–emotional well-being, resilience and risk factors in learning, mental and behavioral health, services in schools and communities to support multitiered prevention and health promotion, and evidence-based strategies for creating safe and supportive schools. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, promote preventive and responsive services that enhance learning, mental and behavioral health, and psychological and physical safety and implement effective crisis prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery.

**Domain 7: Family, School, and Community Collaboration:**\
School psychologists understand principles and research related to family systems, strengths, needs, and cultures; evidence-based strategies to support positive family influences on children’s learning and mental health; and strategies to develop collaboration between families and schools. School psychologists, in collaboration with others, design, implement, and evaluate services that respond to culture and context. They facilitate family and school partnerships and interactions with community agencies to enhance academic and social–behavioral outcomes for children.

**Domain 8: Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populations:**\
School psychologists have knowledge of individual differences, abilities, disabilities, and other diverse characteristics and the impact they have on development and learning. They also understand principles and research related to diversity in children, families, schools, and communities, including factors related to child development, religion, culture and cultural identity, race, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, socioeconomic status, and other variables. School psychologists implement evidence-based strategies to enhance services in both general and special education and address potential influences related to diversity. School psychologists demonstrate skills to provide professional services that promote effective functioning for individuals, families, and schools with diverse characteristics, cultures, and backgrounds through an ecological lens across multiple contexts. School psychologists recognize that equitable practices for diverse student populations, respect for diversity in development and learning, and advocacy for social justice are foundational to effective service delivery. While equality ensures that all children have the same access to general and special educational opportunities, equity ensures that each student receives what they need to benefit from these opportunities.

**Domain 9: Research and Evidence-Based Practice:**\
School psychologists have knowledge of research design, statistics, measurement, and varied data collection and analysis techniques sufficient for understanding research, interpreting data, and evaluating programs in applied settings. As scientist practitioners, school psychologists evaluate and apply research as a foundation for service delivery and, in collaboration with others, use various techniques and technology resources for data collection, measurement, and analysis to support effective practices at the individual, group, and/or systems levels.

**Domain 10: Legal, Ethical, and Professional Practice:**\
School psychologists have knowledge of the history and foundations of school psychology; multiple service models and methods; ethical, legal, and professional standards; and other factors related to professional identity and effective practice as school psychologists. School psychologists provide services consistent with ethical, legal, and professional standards; engage in responsive ethical and professional decision-making; collaborate with other professionals; and apply professional work characteristics needed for effective practice as school psychologists, including effective interpersonal skills, responsibility, adaptability, initiative, dependability, technological competence, advocacy skills, respect for human diversity, and a commitment to social justice and equity.

Note: The domains and descriptions are from the [2020 NASP Standards](https://www.nasponline.org/standards-and-certification/nasp-2020-professional-standards-adopted/nasp-2020-domains-of-practice) and added to the Handbook in 2021. The 2010 NASP domains were used for all program requirements and evaluations in 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.
